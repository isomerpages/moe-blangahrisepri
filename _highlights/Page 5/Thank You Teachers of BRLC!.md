<p>As the school year draws to a close, we are grateful to all our staff who have gone above and beyond to ensure learning continues in this new normal. Earlier this year, our teachers received penned messages on the&nbsp;Thank&nbsp;You&nbsp;â€˜Cher&nbsp;portal to our staff. Put together, these dedications remind us of our work in education. We wish all our students and teachers a reflective school holiday break ahead!
