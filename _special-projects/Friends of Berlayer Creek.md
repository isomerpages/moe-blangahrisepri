# Friends of Berlayer Creek
	
"Friends of Berlayer Creek" is the sequel to our first children's book, ‘The Green Dragonflies and their Swampy Friends’, published in 2022. Both books were illustrated and written by our teachers and students. The sequel, ‘Friends of Berlayer Creek’ is produced by a team of teachers and students with a keen interest in raising environmental awareness, story writing and photography.

Leveraging their passion through the story, they hope to instil the ‘7 Habits of Effective People’ for personal and interpersonal effectiveness. The story also aims to educate readers on making conscious choices by taking positive actions in caring for the environment.

During our Open House in May, we launched the sequel to "The Green Dragonflies and their Swampy Friends", titled "Friends of Berlayer Creek: A Tale of Understanding". This story focuses on some new Chirpy inhabitants in the tree that Bushy and his family and friends live in. The new neighbours did not get along in the beginning, but slowly began to understand each other as the story unfolds.

On 9 July 2023, a team of student leaders and teachers shared the story "Friends of Berlayer Creek: A Tale of Understanding" to an engaged group of audience at library@harbourfront. Holding up colourful props made from recycled materials, the student leaders acted out their characters in the story with much enthusiasm. 

The team delivered the story with much confidence and liveliness. It was indeed a great experience for them to be performing at a public venue. Khush of Primary 5 shared, "It was an honour to be representing the school at such events. I felt very appreciated when I saw our young audience smiling happily throughout the storytelling session."

After the storytelling, our teachers and students led the children in a hands-on art and craft session. Inspired by Brazilian pop artist Roberto Britto, the participants filled plain stickers with vibrant colours and bold patterns as a visual expression of hope, dreams and happiness. It was evident that everyone had a great time!
