The BRPS annual Walk-A-Jog celebrates Children's Day with a purpose for our students. Through the Walk-A-Jog, we aim to build a "can-do" school spirit by encouraging every student to complete the route within a time challenge and to raise funds for Singapore Children's Society (SCS). This year, our teachers lead the way by pledging donations to SCS. Our students are also committed to saving their pocket money to pledge a donation. We believe that our students are never too young to make a difference in other children's lives.

Here are some pictures from last year's Walk-A-Jog.

We are grateful for our students, parents and School Advisory Committee (SAC) who come together to raise funds for a good cause.

Thank you all for the collective effort and making a difference together!
