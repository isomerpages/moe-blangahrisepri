<p><strong>APEX students launch second issue of BRavo!<br></strong>Our APEX (Accelerated Programme to enhance students’ eXperience) team comprising students from Primary 4 and 5, met regularly via Zoom in Semester 2, to curate and write the second issue of&nbsp;<em>BRavo!,&nbsp;</em>the BRPS student newsletter.&nbsp;<em>BRavo!</em>&nbsp;is part of our Viewpoints programme, where we aim to inculcate communications, collaboration and information skills through journalistic experiences. Through the newsletter, students are given a voice to share their views and thoughts. The team learnt a variety of writing styles and text types in the process.</p>
<p>Our APEX students collaborated to write on serious and humorous stories. In this issue, you will read about the APEX students’ views on online gaming, as well as their ideas on a new Fun 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;Friday. They conducted a survey on online gaming with their schoolmates and provided useful recommendations on how they could set up healthy routines to complete their work first (Habit 3: Put First Things First) before spending some time online.</p>
<p>We also feature the best photographs from our inaugural Photographer of The Year awards. It is eye-opening to see the world through the lenses of our students, as they exercised creativity through photography to express their viewpoints. Indeed, our APEX students have prepared an exciting issue that would interest their schoolmates.</p>

<p><strong>About APEX<br></strong>APEX is BRPS’s Accelerated Programme to Enhance students’ eXperience. It is a stretch programme that aims to deepen students’ learning in English, Mathematics and Science and encourages leadership. Besides enriching the students academically, we emphasise on getting the students to apply the values and attitudes they learn to contribute to the communities and environment.</p>
<p>The APEX English programme aims to stretch the linguistic abilities of students who have shown a strong proficiency and keen interest in the English language. The programme aims to develop empathetic communicators, discerning readers and creative inquirers by encouraging the joy of learning. The three main activities include the Scrabble Club, the Debate Club and the Writing Club. As part of the Writing Club, students will also be trained in creative and journalistic writing, and to collectively pen a student newsletter for their peers.</p>
