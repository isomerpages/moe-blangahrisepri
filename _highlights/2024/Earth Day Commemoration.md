We commemorated Earth Day on 16 April, aligning with the global theme of "Planet VS Plastics - 60% Reduction of Plastic Production by 2040."

The day's events commenced with an assembly talk led by student leaders, who provided education surrounding the harmful effects of plastics and the potential consequences of inaction. They emphasised the importance of individual actions by outlining the 5Rs: Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repurpose and Recycle.

Classroom activities were customised to match the varying levels of students. Junior Primary students creatively reused bottle caps for artwork displayed in their classrooms. Middle Primary students took on the challenge of upcycling materials such as toilet rolls and cardboards to create pencil holders for their classrooms. Meanwhile, Senior Primary students delved into research and shared findings on reducing disposable plastic use, presenting their work prominently on their noticeboards.

The highlight of the commemoration was “Plastic-Free Day” which took place during recess. Students and staff were encouraged to bring reusable cutlery and utensils to minimise disposable waste. Some students even showed their commitment by bringing reusable straws for their drinks.

Our Parent Support Group (PSG) actively participated in Earth Day commemoration by assisting in the creation of informative posters featuring actionable 5R tips. These posters were displayed on the community board outside the school's General Office. Additionally, the PSG organised mini quizzes in the library, utilising platforms such as Wordwall and Padlet to increase awareness and encourage students to pledge to reduce plastic usage.

We remain steadfast in our commitment to the principles of the Earth Day message. Student Leaders continued to promote awareness throughout the following week with recess quizzes designed to reinforce the importance of reducing plastic consumption.
Through education, action and ongoing initiatives, we are dedicated to upholding the values of Earth Day, inspiring positive change and fostering a culture of sustainability.
