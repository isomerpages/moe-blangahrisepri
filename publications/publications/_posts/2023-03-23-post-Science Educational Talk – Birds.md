A group of parrot enthusiasts visited Blangah Rise Primary to share about their experiences as owners of pet parrots! They shared with our staff and students the proper care for parrots. They also linked the educational talk to what the students have learnt in their Science textbooks. For example, the different physical adaptations that birds have developed for survival, such as shapes of the beaks and their feather structures!

Many of the birds that the enthusiasts brought along were rescued birds. This session not only educated our students on the importance of pet ownership but also the responsibility that come along with it. Students should carefully consider their ability to provide for a pet's needs before bringing one into their homes.

One of the pet owners even brought along a pair of Serama chickens which belong to one of the world’s smallest chicken breeds!

The experience would not be completed without the up-close interaction with the lovely birds and guest speakers. Our staff and students had the opportunities to feed and observe the birds as they interacted with them.

This session definitely made the learning of Science come alive! We were glad to see the happy and excited faces of our engaged students throughout the session!
