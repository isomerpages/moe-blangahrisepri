<p>Blangah Rise Primary school was established in 25 April 1977 in Telok Blangah Rise. In 1999, as the estate matured, 284 students from the former Jagoh Primary joined the school. In 2000, BRPS shifted to its present building with better facilities in Telok Blangah Heights and became a single session school. The school underwent the Single-Session Primary School (SSPS) Upgrading Project and is now equipped with an indoor Sports Hall, Programme for Active (PAL) rooms, a Teaching Lab as well as a Student Care Centre (SCC) that were completed at the end of 2012. In 2014, the school was one of the 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;phase schools hosting MOE Kindergartens. The MOE Kindergarten became part of the school in 2018.</p>
