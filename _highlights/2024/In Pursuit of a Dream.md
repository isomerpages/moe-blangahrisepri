<p>The Singapore National Paralympic Council hosted a heartwarming Meet and
Greet session that brought together our Paralympians, student artists,
and MediaKids. Highlights included:</p>
<p><strong>Book Presentation to Paralympians:</strong> Each Paralympian received
a special book as a token of appreciation for their dedication and achievements.</p>
<p><strong>Student Artists and Paralympians Interaction:</strong> An unique
and touching segment of the event was the interaction between the student
artists and the Paralympians. The young artists, who had created portraits
of the athletes, were thrilled to meet their subjects in person. Each artist
had the opportunity to take photographs with the Paralympians, who graciously
autographed the artworks. This interaction provided a memorable experience
for the students, reinforcing the connection between art and sports.</p>
<p><strong>Student Engagement:</strong> The students interviewed the Paralympians
and learned about the athletes' personal journeys.&nbsp; The Paralympians
shared their experiences with openness and enthusiasm, inspiring the students
and all attendees with their resilience and determination. Attendees tried
out the different equipment used by the athletes. All were moved by the
stories of perseverance and courage shared by the Paralympians.</p>
<p>It provided a platform for meaningful exchanges between the athletes and
students. The event not only honored the achievements of the Paralympians
but also inspired the next generation to pursue their dreams with passion
and determination.&nbsp; Together, we continue to champion inclusivity,
resilience, and the celebration of human potential.</p>
