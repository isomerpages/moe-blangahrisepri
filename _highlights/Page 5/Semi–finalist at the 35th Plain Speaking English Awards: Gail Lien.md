<p>Gail Lien Zhao Xin from 5 Sapphire represented our school in the 35<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Plain Speaking English Awards (PESA).&nbsp; She captivated the judges, beat 243 other students to be placed in the semi-finals and was placed as the Top 14 in the Upper Primary Category. We are mighty proud of her!</p>
<p>She shared that there was more pressure this year as compared to the last because the semi-finals was held in person and she had to present to an audience on stage. However, she added that she enjoyed the multiple opportunities she had to speak to contestants who represented other schools. Even though she did not emerge as the Champion this year, Gail is deeply appreciative of the opportunities given to her by our school. Gail wrapped up her experience on a hopeful note, “I am not going to stop and I will continue pursing public speaking with the newfound skills and perspectives that I have learnt." Well done, Gail!</p>
