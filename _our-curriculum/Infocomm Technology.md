<h4 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Developing Self-Directed and Collaborative Learners</strong></h4>
<img src="/images/br-junior-reporter_20230331_img_2823-scaled.jpeg">
<p>“We will be using the iPads for the next segment of the lesson and go through some of your homework - in Student Learning Space (SLS) and your workbook!” - This instruction never fails to get our students excited! Our teachers engage students in blended and flipped learning, whereby students are given the opportunity to explore concepts through self-directed learning at home. They deepen their knowledge and understanding when they are back in the classrooms through face-to-face discussions and collaborations. The classrooms are filled with lively and engaging discussions, where our students are sharing their ideas gleaned from SLS. </p>
<p><strong>Effectiveness of ICT-based lessons</strong></p>

"Technology has value added students’ learning because it help to make our lessons more interactive and engaging. Students are able to explore new concepts and discuss with their peers. In addition, we could leverage on the power of technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI)  to provide instant feedback to our students and help them learn better. Technology also helps us to adapt our lessons and strategies to better support our students in learning” </p><p>These are some of the thoughts expressed by our teachers. Technology supports active learning, creating a participatory, connected, and reflective classroom which nurtures the future-ready learners.</p>
<p><strong>Physical and Digital Spaces: Transforming the way students learn<br></strong>From our Full Home-Based Learning experience, our students have developed the confidence to learn with technology in different learning contexts, with teachers blending learning seamlessly in both face-to-face and online spaces. Students shared that they were more confident in raising questions and building on their knowledge through online discussions.</p>
<p>Learning can indeed take place anytime and anywhere as students shared that they were very happy to see their teachers and peers online and learn from one another. 
	
</p><p>From our Full Home-Based Learning experience, we have continued leveraging technology to engage in self-directed and collaborative learning. There are Home-Based Learning days in a semester which provide our students and teachers the opportunity to engage in synchronous learning. “Our Zoom lesson on Home-Based Learning Day was a beneficial learning experience. The students had the opportunity to practise logging into Zoom and interact with one another in an online setting. We engaged in a live discussion on the topic, Whole Numbers, and worked on questions together. This platform provided valuable real-time feedback to my students and enhanced their learning experience. I was also aware of my students’ learning progress and how I can support them better in my next lesson,” said Mrs Tay, a Mathematics teacher. </p>

<p><strong>Building up ICT skills proficiency<br></strong>In order for students to be confident in harnessing technology for learning, they acquire ICT skills through an enrichment programme. The skills are aligned to the MOE ICT Baseline standards and are integrated into the curriculum. Our Primary 1 students are introduced to PC Literacy and touch-typing so as to build up their mastery of navigation in the cyber world. As our students build confidence in harnessing technology, we engage our Primary 2 to 6 students in self-directed and collaborative learning through Google Classrooms. At Primary 2, students apply their touch-typing skills and write a short story using Google Documents.</p>

<p>Introducing presentation skills to our Primary 3 students, they share their story on the Stellar Unit – Fear though Google Slides. Mrs Tay said, “The use of Google Classroom and Slides encourages exploration and creativity. Students learn how to have their text and image work together to express their voice and create meaning.” One of our Primary 3 student, Arlo, said that he enjoys using Google Slides to write his stories. It allows him to edit and improve on his stories easily. He can also share his stories with his friends as they learnt from one another.</p>
<p>Our Primary 4 to 6 students engage in a photojournalism learning activity through the use of Google Slides, as part of our learning activities in&nbsp;<a href="/viewpoints/">Viewpoints</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Values in Real and Cyber World</strong><br>

There is no difference in the way students interact in the real and cyber world. Technology has advanced greatly where communications and sharing of information is made possible through social media or a simple click of a button. It is important to equip our students with Cyberwellness values to develop them to be responsible and discerning users of technology. Topics such as online identity and expression, balanced use of ICT, netiquette, copyright, cyberbullying and cyber contacts are taught to students in a fun and engaging manner. Students learn about these topics through interactive talks, ICT enrichment, Young Photographers, games and activities during recess. As the technology landscape progresses rapidly, it is important to educate our students to make responsible choices online.</p>

<p>Introducing our Cyberwellness Ambassadors' latest endeavor! Inspired by their dedication to promoting media literacy and cyberwellness, our Cyberwellness Ambassadors, consisting of Kai Xiang, Marvell, Aria, Dave and Batrisyia, developed an innovative toolkit aimed at empowering individuals to navigate the digital landscape critically for NCAC 2023.</p>

<p>Through an engaging presentation during the school assembly, students were introduced to the importance of media literacy. Following this, they delved into hands-on learning experiences in the computer lab sessions, utilising our comprehensive Google Site toolkit to discern facts from opinions and evaluate the reliability of online news. </p> 

<p>Beyond the school gates, our outreach extended to families and the wider community. Parents were encouraged to access the toolkit from home, fostering meaningful discussions about responsible digital citizenship within households. Their good work was affirmed by attaining a Bronze Award at NCAC 2023. </p>

<p>With their dedication and innovative approach, our Cyberwellness Ambassadors continued to lead the charge in promoting a safer and more informed digital environment for all.</p>

<p>Safer Internet Day took place on 6 February and it is an annual global initiative which aims to promote safer and more responsible use of online platforms and mobile devices among children. </p>

<p>We commemorated Safer Internet Day starting with an announcement during assembly of its importance to foster a safer online environment for everyone. During recess, our Cyberwellness Ambassadors and Peer Support Leaders provided great support, and engaged their peers in discussions on the importance of balancing their time online and how to cultivate a healthy and balanced relationship with technology. Our Cyberwellness Ambassadors and Peer Support Leaders then guided their peers to make pledges for responsible screen use. </p>
