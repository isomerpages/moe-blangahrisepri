<p>Creativity and curiosity are key ingredients for success. To bring out such natural qualities in our students, Makerspace education gives our Primary 3 students a chance to invent and create. Our P4 students develop their creativity through Visual Arts education, which expands a child's ability to interact with the world around them and provides new skills for self-expression and communication.</p>
<p>In Term 1, both levels created their very own Superhero who defends Singapore. They brainstormed with their teammates on the choice of character and the &ldquo;superpowers&rdquo; it had. Combining their ideas with art, students drew their Superheroes on paper and lined it with a string to make it come alive.</p>
<p>Aaron, a Primary 3 student, commented, &ldquo;The nurse is our group&rsquo;s Superhero because she will take care of the sick. Every sick patient will be nursed back to health with her magic touch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His Primary 4 schoolmate, Varshenee, exclaimed, &ldquo;I really enjoy working with my classmates to create this art piece! Anika drew the face of a policeman, Dyea put the glue on the strings and I helped with the colouring. I am so proud of our team effort!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms Ruth Leong, Form Teacher of Primary 3 Sapphire, shared how she played the role of a Teacher Mentor. &ldquo;I coached my students when they faced difficulties creating a character. I cheered them on to continue outlining the strings even though it was challenging. I gave them a listening ear when they did not see eye to eye with each other.&rdquo; Mr Victor Lim, Form Teacher of Primary 4 Sapphire, also recalled how the learning experience helped the students form stronger friendships.</p>
