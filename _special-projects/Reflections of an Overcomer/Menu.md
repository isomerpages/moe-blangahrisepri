<p>Resilience. Courage. Unity. Perseverance. This is what it takes to be a sportsperson representing Singapore at the Olympics. Inspired by the virtues displayed by our local athletes in overcoming their own challenges, Blangah Rise Primary School has come together to produce writings and photographs to celebrate the virtues they have displayed. Indeed, our local sportsmen and sportswomen have given us the posture and inspiration to overcome the challenges we face as a nation. Through these students works, the school aims to provide some inspiration and motivation to all Singaporeans during these difficult times.</p>
