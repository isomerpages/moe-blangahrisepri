The day was brimming with excitement and joy at the annual BRLC Celebrates! This event is dedicated to celebrating academic accomplishments and the adventurous spirit defining our primary school community. Under the theme "Learning a Life of Adventure," the morning unfolded with exhilaration, inspiration, and the acknowledgment of our students' achievements. We paid tribute to their pursuit of knowledge and their bravery in embracing life's diverse adventures.
The event honored and commemorated our students' academic achievements, sportsmanship, and overall excellence across various disciplines. Beyond the awards, our students held the audience spellbound with captivating performances. The Primary 1 Junior Choir enchanted everyone with renditions of “Wellermen” and “Sanyo.” Additionally, the Primary 2 students staged an intriguing story with a fantastical twist set in a classroom. The Primary 3 and 4 students delivered a Winds and Percussion Performance, while the Primary 6 students showcased their talent through a Cajon Performance. The Dance Club brought vibrancy and energy with their dynamic routines. These artistic expressions not only entertained but also showcased the creative and expressive abilities fostered within our school community.
Parents, teachers, and students gathered to applaud the achievements of our young learners on this special occasion. BRLC Celebrates! was not solely a celebration of academic success but also a testament to the diverse talents that make Blangah Rise Primary School an enriching and unique educational community. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to our stakeholders for contributing to our students' journey of learning a life filled with adventure, making it both enjoyable and meaningful.
