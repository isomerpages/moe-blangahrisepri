Dr. Seuss Day 2023 was a blast at Blangah Rise Primary School!

Our Junior Primary students had a wonderful time celebrating the beloved children's author and his iconic characters. They had the opportunity to read classic Dr. Seuss stories in the classroom, and engage in fun literacy activities to deepen their understanding of Dr. Seuss's creative writing style.

The highlight of the day was the special visit from the Cat in the Hat himself, who delighted the students with his playful antics and mischievous spirit. Students were thrilled to meet one of their favourite literary characters in person, and it was a joy to see their faces light up with excitement and wonder.

Through this celebration, our students not only had fun, but also developed a deeper appreciation for the power of storytelling and creativity. We believe that cultivating a love of reading and imagination at a young age is crucial for a child's academic and personal growth, and we are proud to have provided our students with this enriching experience.

Thank you to all our students, teachers, and staff who made Dr. Seuss Day 2023 a memorable and magical day!
