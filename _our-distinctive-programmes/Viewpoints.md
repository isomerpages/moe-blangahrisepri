<p><strong>Viewpoints: Empowering our Blangahnites!</strong>
</p>
<p>Viewpoints, a tiered modular communication programme, brings out the critical
writer, confident debater, creative photographer, and conscientious journalist
in every Blangahnite!</p>
<p>Viewpoints promotes 21st century competencies such as civic literacy,
communication, collaboration, and critical thinking skills. Students are
empowered to express their viewpoints in written, and verbal form - from
newsletters, photographs to news broadcasts and debates.</p>
<p>All students benefit from Tier 1 English (EL) and Mother Tongue (MTL)
communication programmes that enhance language skills and design authentic
learning experiences through Photo, Print and Broadcast journalism.</p>
<p>Broadcast journalism equips the middle primary students with script writing
and presentation skills. They present their scripts in front of the camera
with confidence. In addition, in the MTL programme, they pen a level newsletter,
and learn basic news-reporting skills to convey facts and opinions.</p>

critical thinking skills to present viewpoints to support a stand. Through
intra and inter-class debates, most students get to pit their wits against
