<p>On 2 February 2021, the school came together to congratulate our newly appointed Prefectorial Council comprising six office bearers and forty-one&nbsp;prefects. Our prefects underwent a thorough selection process comprising interviews and discussions with teachers. They are representatives of their fellow Blangahnites as they exemplify the best qualities that every student aspires to have. Our prefects will continue to receive training to maximise their potential, as they are nurtured to become compassionate leaders with integrity and resilience. Head Prefect, Aggie (6O), reflected &ldquo;I am truly grateful that I have been given the opportunity to serve the school and community. The prefects and I will take on this mission with purpose, fulfill our duties responsibly and be good role models to our peers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This year, we were not able to invite parents to school to attend their child&rsquo;s Prefect Investiture. Instead, the parents were invited to witness the ceremony via a live Zoom feed. The parents penned a congratulatory note and words of encouragement on a specially designed card for their child. The card was presented to the prefects during the ceremony, and they were touched by the gesture. It was indeed a moment of sweet surprise for the prefects to receive the thoughtful gift from their parents! Assistant Head Prefect, Ngyuen Minh Dat (5S), shared, &ldquo;This year&rsquo;s Investiture was entirely different from last year&rsquo;s. Our parents were not able to put on the badges for us. Nonetheless, I am still appreciative that we were still able to have an investiture via Zoom, with SMM in place. I was also very encouraged by the words of wisdom and encouragement from my parents.&rdquo;</p>
