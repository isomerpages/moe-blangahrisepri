<p>On the morning of 23 November 2022, our Primary 6 students waited with trepidation to collect their results. For the first time post-covid, they collected their PSLE results in the school hall. More importantly, our supportive teachers and parents were present with them physically, reminding our Blangahnites that with our community, they would not be alone in celebrating their successes and growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well done P6s! We hope that you will bring with you on your next lap of education the same sense of wonder and joy for learning that you have displayed within our doors!</p>
