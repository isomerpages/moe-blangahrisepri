<p>CCA is part of the school&rsquo;s total curriculum to develop the child holistically. There are 4 categories of CCA in BRPS: Sports and Games, Clubs and Societies, Aesthetics, and Uniformed Groups.</p>
<p>These CCAs provide a&nbsp;platform for our pupils to develop values, skills and knowledge&nbsp;through an area&nbsp;of their interest. In CCAs, pupils experience joyful&nbsp;learning with others, take on leadership roles and work&nbsp;together as teams to achieve common goals. Teachers facilitate pupils&rsquo; reflection&nbsp;and guide them in their development&nbsp;as confident learner and caring leaders.</p>

<h3><strong>Level Interest Areas</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Level Interest Areas</strong>&nbsp;provide our students with more holistic and enriching learning experiences. They are also a way for Form Teachers to play the role of a Teacher Mentor when they build intentional and meaningful relationships with students while working on projects together. The extension of such learning beyond CCA on Monday is purposefully planned and teachers are always looking out for every opportunity to engage our students.</p>
