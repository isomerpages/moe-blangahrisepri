Dear Parents / Guardians,


As 2023 comes to a close and the holidays beckon, you may like to take some time to appreciate your childâ€™s teacher by nominating them for the Caring Teacher Awards 2024. The Caring Teacher Awards (CTA) aims to acknowledge teachers in our schools who go beyond the call of duty, nurturing the holistic development of their students and ensuring their charges grow up to be confident, independent and resilient learners for our nation. We look forward to receiving your nominations. You may visit this link https://www.cta.nie.edu.sg/ or  find the QR code to submit your nominations in the poster below by 12 Jan 2024. Thank you.
