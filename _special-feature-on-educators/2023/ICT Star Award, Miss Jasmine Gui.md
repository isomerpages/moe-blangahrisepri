"Miss Gui introduced audiobooks to us using Student Learning Space (SLS), and it was awesome! We got to read different stories and answer questions online. It was like reading in a whole new way!" Katherine, from Primary 2, reflected.

Indeed, this was one of the platforms which Miss Jasmine Gui had leveraged technology to transform and enhance her students’ learning experiences. 

Miss Jasmine Gui was a recipient of the BRPS ICT Star Award 2023. Being a Primary 1 and Science Department e-Coach, she demonstrated her expertise in guiding colleagues through ICT matters and seamlessly integrating technology into teaching methodologies. Recognised for her approachability, Miss Gui has created a supportive community of educators through her generous sharing of knowledge.

**Culture of Knowledge-Sharing**
</p><p>Through her commitment to innovation, she had spearheaded a paradigm shift in educational resources - a centralised repository on Google Drive for the seamless sharing of departmental teaching and learning resources. This initiative has not only facilitated greater collaboration among the Science teachers but has also nurtured a culture of knowledge-sharing, thus, enriching the overall learning experiences for our students. Mr. Ooi, HOD Character and Citizenship Education and fellow Science teacher, affirmed Miss Gui's work, saying, "Jasmine had revamped our P5 Science teaching materials to make them more exciting and encouraged student participation through collaboration."</p>

**Leveraging multimedia tools for learning**
<p>Miss Gui's innovative teaching method involves her skillful utilisation of multimedia tools, where slides and videos serve as dynamic tools for making thinking visible. Through collaborative learning experiences facilitated by interactive materials, students not only acquire content but actively contribute to the learning. This builds a classroom culture that values students learning and growing together.</p>

**Flipped Learning**
<p>Furthermore, Miss Gui's use of the flipped classroom approach has redefined traditional styles of learning by empowering students to take greater ownership. Kayden, Primary 5 shared, "Miss Gui's lessons are very engaging. I learnt the content from home and applied concepts gleaned through class discussions with my friends. This provided me with opportunities to explore the concepts and ideas more, as compared to reading from the textbooks.” This sentiment captures the essence of Miss Gui’s teaching, where flipped learning, multimedia-rich resources and collaborative learning combine to build a curious, fun and collaborative classroom.</p>

**Cyber Wellness**
<p>Beyond her teaching roles, Miss Gui has played an integral part in the school Cyber wellness team, contributing significantly to the planning and implementation of cyber wellness activities. Her commitment extends to the National Cyber wellness Advocacy Challenge (NCAC) Competition Team, where she served as a Key teacher mentor, coaching students in advocating for a safer online environment. The team attained the Bronze Award for NCAC.</p>
