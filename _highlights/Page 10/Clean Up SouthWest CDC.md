<p>To all students and parents! Thank you very much for your support in making Clean up South West! 2020 a roaring success. Blangah Rise Learning Campus conducted it in collaboration with South West CDC and E-Bridge Pre-School. We collected 222kg of paper and 159kg of clothes. This allowed us to donate 74 noodle packets and 53 rice packets for the needy in the South West district. We would like to extend our utmost gratitude and this would not have been successful without the help of each and every one of you. We would also like to give special thanks to E-Bridge Pre-School for joining us in making a difference in the lives of others.</p>
