<h4><strong>A Nature &amp; Heritage Trail by Blangah Rise Primary School (BRPS)</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Saturday / April 29, 2019</strong></p>
<p>To commemorate the Bicentennial, our student-docents of Blangah Rise Primary School led members of the public on The Green Snapshot Trail around Telok Blangah and Mount Faber. The students shared about the area’s rich and green history, including facts about historical landmarks such as the Temenggong Mosque and even&nbsp;<em>kampong&nbsp;</em>remedies made from plants in the area. &nbsp;A long-time resident of Telok Blangah, Mrs Teh-Ooi Gim Siew, shared with us that despite urban developments, the estate has managed to stay tranquil and green.</p>
<p>At Mount Faber View, participants took time to pen their dreams for Singapore. Ms C. Dharani wrote, “I would like us to live as a harmonious community despite differences we may face. I would also like Singaporeans to be friendlier to each other and to the environment.” Likewise, our student-docent, Nick Yew, also envisioned “a Singapore where our environment and heritage are conserved for future generations.”</p>
