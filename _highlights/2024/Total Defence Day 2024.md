<p>On 6th February, our Blangnites commemorated Total Defence Day. It is
crucial for our students to be prepared, vigilant, and knowledgeable about
what to do in times of emergency. We conducted a lockdown exercise in the
class and a fire drill evacuation in the school field. “The lockdown exercise
and fire drill equipped us with knowledge on what to do in times of emergency.
It is important that we know what to do so that we can stay safe” reflected
Mahasina, Primary 4.</p>
<p>On February 16th, the students in our school had sweet potato porridge
during recess. This experience allowed them to understand the hardships
that was experienced by the civilians during wartime when food was scarce.
”Although the porridge wasn't particularly tasty, we still enjoyed it as
it served as a reminder of the importance of keeping our country safe to
avoid going into war!” mentioned Zheng Hong, Primary 4. Krush from Primary
6 said that eating the porridge made him appreciate the daily food that
he has now.</p>
