<p>We envision ourselves as a joyful school of confident learners and caring leaders. We have a customized Character and Citizenship curriculum for holistic development of students.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>GROW</h4>
<h4>&ldquo;Plant a seed so your heart will grow&rdquo;</h4>
<h4>Hafez</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>In Blangah Rise Primary School, we grow caring leaders who support others and are deeply rooted to Singapore. We help every student see the &ldquo;Leader in Me'' and also the power of peer support through the &ldquo;Leader in Us&rdquo;. These efforts are woven intentionally into every aspect of school life in BRPS, from the classroom to CCAs and after school programmes.</p>
