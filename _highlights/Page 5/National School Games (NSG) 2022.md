<h4><strong>National School Games (NSG) 2022</strong></h4>
<p>2022 marks a very special year for BRPS. For the first time in our school’s history, we formed a senior boys team to participate in NSG (Floorball). Floorball is one of the modular CCA introduced at House Practice where our students’ interest in Floorball was piqued.</p>
<p>The senior boys team was formed just 1 month before the start of NSG. In this short period of time, the team trained twice a week. Even though this was the first time we competed in Floorball, we played well as a team and emerged 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;Runner-up in the group stages and advanced to the top 16 knock-out stage.</p>
<p>Our team’s foray into NSG (Floorball) and its resilience was recognized by the NSG officials. A few teacher coaches from other schools commended on our valiant effort. Our outstanding goalkeeper, Rafadil received the NSG Sportsmanship Award in recognition of his sports and character excellence. Well done team!</p>
