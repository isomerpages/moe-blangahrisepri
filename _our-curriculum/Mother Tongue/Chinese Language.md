<p><strong>Description of Programmes:<br /></strong><strong><em>Blended Learning for All</em></strong></p>
<p>Learning of the Chinese Language does not take place only in the classroom. Online lessons and e-learning tasks are planned for our students so that they can continue to learn the language at their own pace at home. Students can complete assignments set by their Chinese teachers through the&nbsp;<strong>Student Learning Space (SLS)</strong>. With the various functions of SLS, students can view videos uploaded by their teacher, complete online homework, and even upload presentation videos of their own.</p>
<p>In class, our students also get to use iPads for interactive activities to support their learning. Students can use these activities, such as educational games on Nearpod, to assess their own learning. Teachers can also provide immediate and individualised feedback after the students have completed the activities.</p>

<p><strong><em>Inquiry-based Learning<br /></em></strong>&ldquo;May I conduct an interview with you? I would like to find out what you do and learn in your CCA.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>During our Inquiry-based Learning (IBL) week, we can often hear our students busy interviewing their peers or conducting surveys as they work on different IBL tasks assigned to them. Through Inquiry-based Learning (IBL), our students engage in self-directed and collaborative learning. IBL, paired with authentic learning, promotes critical and inventive thinking skills in our students as they attempt to solve real-world problems. For instance, students apply the sentence structures they learnt in their Chinese Language lessons and present them confidently to their peers.</p>

<p><strong><em>Chinese Language Fortnight<br /></em></strong>Every year, the Chinese Fortnight will be conducted for Chinese Language students. It is an important platform for experiential learning of the Chinese Language. Students get to experience and appreciate the Chinese Language and the Chinese culture through engaging cultural activities, such as traditional handicraft making, language-related games (think&nbsp;idioms and riddles!) and even performing arts (drama).</p>

<p><strong><em>Mother Tongue (Chinese) Camps<br /></em></strong>Have you painted a traditional Chinese fan before? What about Chinese Calligraphy?&nbsp;How about painting a traditional Chinese fan? All these cultural activities keep our students busy during our Chinese Language camps. The annual camp deepens our students&rsquo; understanding of the Chinese culture and its traditions and encourages the use of the Chinese Language. An engaging environment is created for our P4 and P6 students to learn and use the Chinese Language frequently and in an authentic setting. During the camps, students are exposed to various learning experiences that will involve the Chinese Language and culture.</p>
