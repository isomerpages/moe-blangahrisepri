<p>Our photography competition is back for the second year! This is an opportunity for our students to apply photography skills gleaned from our school&rsquo;s distinctive programme, Young Photographers. The theme for this competition is &ldquo;Our Environment&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The sub-themes for each level are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Primary 2: Sky</li>
<li>Primary 3: Flora</li>
<li>Primary 4: Water</li>
<li>Primary 5: Fauna</li>
<li>Primary 6: Landscape</li>
</ul>
<p>Through the competition, we aim to engage our students in self-directed learning through brainstorming of ideas, extending photography composition techniques knowledge through Student Learning Space (SLS). Students can also synergise their creative skills, photography skills, and writing skills to interpret the theme &ldquo;Our Environment&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Check out our students&rsquo; Best Photo Story and Honourable Mention pieces. A hearty congratulations to all winners!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>G. AARYA</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>2 Ruby</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This photo was taken during sunset at the Raffles Marina Lighthouse. I wanted to capture the beautiful sunset with Raffles Marina Lighthouse, Tuas Second Link and Johor Bahru in the front. I used the Rule of Thirds for the lighthouse and Johor Bahru. This also shows the vastness of the sky and the close relationship between Singapore and Malaysia.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Most flowers grow in gardens but a small yellow flower can grow not only in gardens but also along roadsides, gaps in walls, cracks in pathways and even beside drains. I found this flower. It is resilient because it is growing strongly on its own as compared to other flowering plants. We should learn to persevere through difficult conditions just like this flower. I used the composition technique of Rule of Thirds to take this photograph.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>LEE JUN HIM</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>4 Topaz</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I used the composition technique of Rule of Thirds to take this photograph. This is a scene containing flowing water from a "shishi-odoshi", which is a Japanese water fountain. Water gives life to the plant.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>LIM GHIM SUAN</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>5 Sapphire</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">When you look at yourself in the mirror, what do you see? Do you think about your past, your present or your future? The turtle is curious about what lies ahead of it. Sometimes, in our fast-paced society, we neglect our environment. Hence, we should slow down our pace to reflect on what can be done to protect Mother Nature. I used the composition techniques of Contrast and Rule of Thirds when taking this photograph.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>MUHAMMAD NURFIDYAN BIN MUHAMMAD FAIRUZ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>6 Topaz</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I took a photograph of this sunset as it is a one-time chance not to miss it. Unlike most sunsets, this is pink, which is very rare.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Honourable Mention</strong></h4>
<img style="width: 65%;" src="/images/pj6.jpg" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>KOH KAI ZHE, ETHAN</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>2 Opal</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">It was a bright and sunny afternoon with a radiant sky. Balls of fluffy white cotton clouds drifted across the vast blue sky. From a distance, dark gray clouds could be seen covering the sky and it felt like it was about to rain. A huge sound of rumbling thunder echoed through my ears and a sudden gust of wind hit my face. As I felt light drizzle on me, my mood instantly changed from cheerful like the bright sky to gloomy like the dark sky as I had to stop my activities. I quickly hid indoors, and soon after, a storm started brewing.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>NING HAOBO</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>2 Topaz</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This is the Water Light Show at Marina Bay Sands. After returning to the new normal post Covid-19, everyone can enjoy more time outdoors. This water light show was entertaining. Everyone came together at Marina Bay to watch this show. It symbolizes unity. The night looked picturesque. It was amazing and I was so happy to watch the show. It was the best day ever for me!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>NING HAOHAN</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>2 Sapphire</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The cloudy sky is spectacular and blue. Blue is one of my favourite colours. This photo was taken before the rain. I can see this view from my window. This view makes me very happy!</p>
<img style="width: 90%;" src="/images/pj9.jpg" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>YONG KA HYUN, KATIE</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>3 Opal</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This flower is bright and beautiful, just like the sun!</p>
<img style="width: 70%;" src="/images/pj10.jpg" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>VELUMRUGAN SAATHVIKA</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>3 Topaz</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I took this photograph while my family and I were walking in Telok Blangah Hill Park. The name of this flower is Heliconia. This flower has a vibrant red colour with little yellow banana-like shapes in it. Its attractive colour will attract insects. These flowers, with its long leaves, sway in the wind, looking like it is waving its hand to welcome us. Looking at these flowers makes me happy. These beautiful flowers enhance the beauty of the park.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>ISABELLA DZARFAN</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>3 Topaz</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Lonely yet strong flowers blossom within harsh concrete.</p>
<img style="width: 80%;" src="/images/pj12.jpg" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>KHUSH PAREEK</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>4 Sapphire</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I took this photograph at Labrador Park using framing as a composition technique. Water is key for life, trade, business and the economy. It connects us with nature and helps us to evolve and flourish. Nature has water in abundant quantities and this helps to connect our economic activities with nature. The photograph shows sunset at sea. On one side there is a factory which has a chimney where smoke is coming out and on the other side there is a trade port. Rays of setting sun look mesmerizing, with the calm sea water reflecting beautiful shades of sunlight.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PHUA SER YEN</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>4 Opal</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Water beautifies everything around us, from nature to buildings. When there is water involved, everything feels calm, relaxing and most importantly, much more beautiful than before. So, water is very important, not just for beautifying things, but for other uses too, including drinking and washing your hands. Water is very important, let's try to conserve it as much as possible.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>NATHANIEL LIEM</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>4 Topaz</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Plants need water<br />We need water<br />Animals need water<br />Living things need water<br />But where do we get water?<br />We get water from rivers<br />from glaciers<br />from oceans<br />from seas<br />from ponds.<br />So step inside, like you are pictured in the Rule of Thirds<br />and learn more.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>6 Topaz</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The sun glint towards the cloud, reflecting in my eyes as I admire the heavenly scenery with a smile on my face.</p>
<img style="width: 80%;" src="/images/pj16.jpg" />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>CHOI YUCHAN</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>6 Topaz</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">As the human population increases, deforestation happens and houses are built on land. This seems like a good thing for us humans, but on the other hand, it also means that we are destroying animals' homes. Maybe it is okay to build houses where there are no animals but when we are clearing the forest, we should not forget that there are other animals living in there.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>ANIKA LYKA BINTE JAYAKASUMA</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>6 Sapphire</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Sunsets are a symphony of colours, which sings humans and other living things to sleep. It continually changes in chaos and colours, especially when there are clouds to display shapes. Sunsets happens daily. They are elegant, appealing and beautiful. Some days the sky can be dark and gloomy.</p>
