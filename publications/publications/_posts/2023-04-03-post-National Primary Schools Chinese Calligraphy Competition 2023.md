Our students had the opportunity to experience the writing of Chinese characters as an art form by participating in the National Primary Schools Chinese Calligraphy Competition 2023. The competition was jointly organised by Hong Wen School and Hong Wen Alumni.

The aim of the competition was to cultivate the appreciation of Chinese culture through calligraphy, popularise the art of calligraphy and celebrate the festive season. Our students Danae, Jun Him and Sherlyn from 5 Sapphire, Mills, Judith, Kai Rou and Ser Yen from 5 Topaz, participated in the competition and put in a lot of effort and attention on each stroke as they wrote the Chinese characters. It was definitely a different experience of writing the Chinese characters with an ink brush, as compared to writing with a pen. Our students received the certificate of participation for their good work.

Danae shared that she had learnt simple calligraphy and hoped to practise more to hone her calligraphy skills. Mills felt happy to be able to participate in the competition. He would be practising more and looked forward to hone his skills further and participate in the competition again next year.
