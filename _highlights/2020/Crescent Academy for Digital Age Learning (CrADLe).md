<p>The theme for this year’s Crescent Academy for Digital Age Learning (CrADLe) Webinar was Home-Based Learning: Overcoming Challenges, Igniting Innovation. CrADLe is a platform for educators to come together to share and celebrate best practices.</p>
<p>Mrs Teresa Tay and Mr James Han shared about our school’s journey in preparing our teachers to carry out home-based learning. Some teachers became e-coaches to support their colleagues through peer lesson observations and providing technical advice. Teachers learnt from one another through the termly Staff Bulletin and the inaugural Virtual Learning Festival. A Staff Journal was given to all teachers for their lesson planning and weekly reflections.</p>
<p>Mr Leow Qinjin shared about two Primary 6 Science lesson packages that he had created on the topics of Forces and Food Chains and Food Webs. The packages were a mix of online home-based learning and in-class lessons – also known as Blended Learning. Mr Leow carefully designed activities to deepen students’ learning, excite them to read up beyond what was assigned and promote online collaboration among students.</p>
<p>Our teachers will continue to innovate and collaborate to carry out meaningful and interesting lessons – both online and in-class – for our students.</p>
