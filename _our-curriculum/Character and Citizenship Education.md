Our educational philosophy revolves around providing our students with a well-rounded education that equips them with skills crucial for their future endeavours. We believe in instilling future-ready skills   that prepare them for their future. Through partnering our parents, we work hand in hand to reinforce these essential skills and values, ensuring our students receive 	a forward-looking education.

**Our Values**

Here at Blangah Rise Pri school, values are not just taught but are woven into the very fabric of our curriculum. Our Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) programme is dedicated to cultivating students of integrity, empathy, and excellence.   We prioritize building strong character, fostering critical thinking and ethical decision-making. We cherish the partnership with parents, recognizing that together, we can truly make a meaningful impact.

In our school, we wholeheartedly embrace the Virtues Project, a global initiative promoting the daily practice of virtues. Through the implementation of the Five Strategies, we actively guide our students towards discovering deeper meaning and happiness in their lives. 

Clara Chu, a Primary 4 student, shares, "Ms Teo always talks about virtues like kindness in class. It makes our classroom environment very positive and kind." 

This project serves as a powerful tool for parents and teachers alike, empowering students to embody virtues such as kindness and honesty in their daily school life.

<br>**Building a strong sense of community and belonging**<br>

Our school-based CCE curriculum integrates the 7-Habits   . Learning Experiences, programmes to benefit the community and opportunities to practice and demonstrate these habits are specially designed for our students. By working alongside partners such as Lion Befrienders, Peopleâ€™s Association, and Sports SG, as well as through our Values in Action initiatives, we actively demonstrate these habits to support those in need.

We aim to develop students who are aware of community issues and are also equipped with the skills and drive to tackle them. Through community projects, discussions, or awareness initiatives, we aim to empower our students to step forward with courage and make a meaningful impact, no matter how small it may seem. Khush   Pareek, a Primary 6 student, reflects, "I've discovered that being proactive means not only taking initiative for myself but also reaching out to support others in our community. It's about making a positive difference in the lives of those around me."

**Student Wellness**

In our school, we prioritize the holistic well-being o f our students -  academic success, physical health, mental clarity, and emotional resilience. Just as physical fitness sharpens the mind, nurturing mental and emotional health is crucial for a child's holistic development. Beyond academics, we foster opportunities for students to engage with others and contribute meaningfully to their community. Initiatives like Student Wellness Day and collaborative projects encourage teamwork and empathy. Explore our Student Wellness page for more details on how we nurture student well-being.

Our Enhanced Education and Career Guidance (ECG) program goes beyond traditional classroom learning. We provide numerous hands-on opportunities for students to delve into their values, interests, and skills. This not only equips them with the mindset and abilities essential for lifelong learning but also prepares them to make informed decisions about their secondary school education and beyond.
