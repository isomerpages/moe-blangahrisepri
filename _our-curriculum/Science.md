<p><strong>Scientific Inquiry and Scientific Method</strong><br>Scientific inquiry is defined as the activities and processes which scientists and students engage in to study the natural and physical world around us. We believe that teaching the scientific method to students is to teach them how to think critically, learn, solve problems, and make informed decisions. These skills are integral to every aspect of a student’s education and life. As our students grow up in an increasingly technologically and scientifically advanced world, we give our students the knowledge and skills to be scientifically literate to thrive in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Description of Programmes:<br></strong>We put together a suite of Science programmes with the aim of providing students with experiences to nurture students to have a curious and rational mind, a loving heart, and an innovative spirit.</p>
<p><strong>Inquiry-based Learning using Science Kits<br></strong>The use of science kits in the science classroom changes teacher and student roles. It alters learning environment by moving instruction away from more didactic, teacher-centered forms to more hands-on, student-centered forms. These kits serve as effective classroom tools to support hands-on curriculum supplements. The main objective is to engage all students in active, meaningful learning where learning is associated with hands-on instructional strategies.</p>

<p><u><strong>Outdoor Experiential Learning Experience</strong><br></u>The outdoor classroom fosters active, hands-on, inquiry-based learning in a real world setting; making learning a multi-sensory experience to retain knowledge more effectively. Learning in a less-structured environment, students are provided with a different learning experience from that of the classroom. Learning Journeys are also integral to enriching the learning experience of students. &nbsp;They help to make real and concrete what has been learnt in the classrooms and broaden the mental horizons of our students.</p>

<p><strong>Enrichment Activities<br></strong>To further enrich students’ learning in Science, the school partners with external agencies to conduct enrichment activities. Through the expertise of our partners, students take part in various engaging activities throughout the year. By working with Science Centre to bring in specimens of animals and plants, students have the opportunity to observe and compare the organisms not commonly found in their environment. To better understand energy conversion, students get to create their own wind turbines to convert kinetic energy into electrical energy to light up LED bulbs.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Animal Moments</strong></span><br>This programme aims to raise awareness on animal-related issues and educate students on responsible pet ownership through assembly talks conducted by teachers and government organisations like the SPCA and AVA. Students then learn to be kind and empathetic to our four-legged friends. Under the supervision of our teachers and Science Assistant, students are given the opportunities to have hands-on experiences to learn to take care of small animals.

<p><strong>Biodiversity Corridor<br></strong>The Biodiversity Corridor is part of the school’s effort to equip students with socio-emotional skills and leadership qualities. We inculcate virtues such as care, respect and responsibility to create a lasting impact on the students’ own personal and interpersonal growth through the school’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP) led by the Science Department. The opportunity to observe, interact, care and learn about animals not only enriches their learning about nature, ecology and relationships, it also inspires them on their learning and discovery journeys as students will be curious to find out more about the animals.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Garden Trails - Blooming Garden and The Garden of Hope<br></strong>With the objectives of providing our students with outdoor experiential learning to complement the teaching and learning of Science as well as to provide our students with an authentic platform for Value-in-Action (VIA) project, classes are each assigned a garden plot to take care of the plants. This provides opportunity for students and teachers to build positive teacher-student relationships as well as imbue in students a sense of responsibility to take care of the environment.</p>

Our NEW Garden – Tranquil Garden

As part of our continuing efforts to enhance the physical and learning environment in the school for our students, we have added Tranquil Garden to the school’s Biodiversity Corridor next to the Primary 1 classrooms. The Tranquil Garden provides a calming and serene space to promote students’ wellness. Within the garden, students will be able to explore under the canopy of the Auracaria Pine Trees. This garden is designed with seating areas for personal or small group contemplation as it is divided into sections by bamboo lattices and boulders. The tables &amp; seats are customised to blend in with the natural environment. Teachers and students may utilize the space in the garden to engage in wellness activities.

The Tranquil Garden is built to engage students through a multi-sensory approach. From the moment students step into the garden, they will be greeted by a wide variety of plants visually. One of the special features is the Tamarind Tree. The living tree is repositioned almost horizontally to house a wide variety of epiphytes and orchids. Beneath its trunk, the moist and shaded environment provides a conducive habitat for other organisms like moss to thrive. The garden also has a cascading water fountain and built-in outdoor speakers which allow for recorded music or storytelling to be played in certain parts of the garden. We are sure our staff and students will love the garden!

<p><strong>Go&nbsp;<a href="mailto:Green@BRPS">Green@BRPS</a><br></strong>Going green is an integral part of being a Blangahnite. It teaches our students to respect self, others and the environment. Events such as Earth Week, World Water Day and practices such as the 4Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Refuse) are emphasised by our Green Ambassadors and Science teachers. Selected students are also given leadership opportunities to work with organisations such as NEA and Sembwaste to provide authentic platforms for them to explore environmental issues. Through such partnerships, they learn to take action to improve the environment around them and achieve awards that accredit the school’s green practices. These activities include conducting recycling drives in the school, taking part in environmental challenges and creating educational posters for both the school community and neighbourhood.</p>
