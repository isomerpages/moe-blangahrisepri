<p>We are delighted to celebrate the good efforts of our students who participated in the AISS mural art&nbsp;programme at the start of the year. The mural they have created received good feedback and we are delighted to display it at Harbourfront MRT station. Catch it as you walk out from the MRT towards exit C!</p>
