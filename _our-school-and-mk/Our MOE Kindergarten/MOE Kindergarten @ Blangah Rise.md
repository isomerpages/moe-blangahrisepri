<p><strong>A note from our Centre Head</strong><br>At MOE Kindergarten @ Blangah Rise we believe that children are curious and active learners. Our teachers seek to engage children to make discoveries and explore the world around them. We help our children to learn concepts and develop good learning dispositions.</p>
<p>The preschool years are critical in laying a strong foundation for children in the 6 learning areas: language and literacy, numeracy, social emotional competencies, aesthetics and creative expression, discovery of the world, and gross motor skills. Our teachers engage children in purposeful play and quality interactions to facilitate children&rsquo;s participation and involvement in learning.</p>
<p>We seek to involve parents as partners in centre activities and learning as we believe that parents&rsquo; involvement helps the child to feel safe and secure in the learning environment. Children also develop better social skills and show improved behaviour when their parents are involved at school.</p>
<p>We plan collaborative activities with the primary school so that our kindergarten children can build confidence and social skills with children of different age groups and be familiar and comfortable in the physical school environment.</p>
<p>My team and I look forward to an exciting year together to give our children a strong start for life!</p>
<p>Ms Marina Ho<br />Centre Head</p>

<p><strong>Our Curriculum:<br /></strong>MK@BR believes that children are&nbsp;<strong>curious, active and competent learners</strong>. Guided by the key teaching and learning principles in MOE&rsquo;s Nurturing Early Learners (NEL) framework, our curriculum has been intentionally designed to nurture the&nbsp;<strong>holistic development</strong>&nbsp;of our children so as to support the transition process and to lay a strong foundation for life-long learning. The curriculum is also guided by two pedagogical practices:&nbsp;<strong>learning through purposeful play and learning through quality interactions</strong>. It includes a distinctive Singapore flavour, whereby our activities, teaching and learning materials and resources incorporate local stories, songs and dances, so as to allow our children to learn in familiar and authentic contexts.</p>

<p><strong><u>Semester 1 Updates</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Weeks of Wonder<br /></strong>The K1 children went through a Week Of Wonder (WOW) Project in Term 1. As the children could choose their own topics of interest to investigate, the K1 Love children decided to find out more about bananas while the K1 Respect children did their investigation into volcanoes. They went through the process of I Wonder, I Find Out, I Know.</p>
<p>After compiling a list of questions about what they &ldquo;wondered&rdquo; about, the children took a weekend to find out answers to their questions through borrowing books from the library or looking into the internet with their parents. The children then came back to school to share the information with their friends in class.</p>
<p>Children were delighted to find the answers and additional information through this process. Amongst the many questions the K1 Love children had, they found out how green bananas tasted, how long it takes a banana to ripen, and whether bananas have seeds. They also composed a rhyme song on bananas with their teacher to conclude the project!</p>
<p>K1 Respect children were curious about how volcanoes erupt, why there is fire when the volcanoes erupt and how we can make our own volcano. The teacher then used simple materials like baking soda, vinegar, a water bottle and plasticine to make a &ldquo;volcano&rdquo; so that the children could visualize how larva flows out from the volcano. It was an engaging time of learning for K1 Respect children!</p>

<p><strong><u>On To A Strong Start<br /></u></strong>At MOE Kindergarten, activities are planned throughout the year with the primary school students to enrich our children&rsquo;s learning. This regular exposure to the primary school helps our K2 children to make a smooth transition to Primary 1. Joint celebrations include Chinese New Year, National Day, Hari Raya Puasa, Deepavali, Racial Harmony Day, Teachers&rsquo; Day and Children&rsquo;s Day. They also participate in joint Drama and STEM activities with the lower primary students.</p>
<p>Our K2s end the year in Term 4 with 5 weeks of experiential learning. They find out what is in a &ldquo;bigger school&rdquo;, understand the changes they will experience and learn how to manage their feelings and adapt to change. They learn by asking curious questions to find out more about primary school life. They receive the answers to their questions through interviews with the Principal and Vice-Principals. The questions that our children ask show thought and eagerness to know more about primary school life. Some questions that our children have asked include: How many classrooms does the primary school have?&rdquo; &ldquo;What kind of CCAs are there? &ldquo;How many subjects are there?&rdquo; What food do we eat in the canteen?&rdquo; Our school leaders patiently answer every question posed to them.</p>
<p>Our children also tour the primary school and view the many different areas and special rooms such as the Blooming Garden, basketball court, library, Science labs and Art rooms. Different lessons like PE, English, Music and Art are arranged for our children to participate in with the lower primary children. This exposure helps our children to feel assured that lessons in a &ldquo;big&rdquo; school are not as different as what they experience in MOE Kindergarten. Our children definitely display readiness to transit to primary school learning as they are able to follow through the different lessons.</p>
<p>On different days, our children go to the canteen to practise counting money to buy snacks, mainly fruit cups and drinks. In Blangah Rise Primary School, SATS Catering provides recess meals for the primary school children, hence our kindergarten children also have the opportunity to order a snack from SATS and learn to tap their card to make their purchase. This is part of the unique experience at MK@Blangah Rise.</p>
<p>Our children document their experiences in their Transition Journal. This allows them to reflect on and capture precious moments of their transition experience.</p>
<p>Our children have much to look forward to when they move on to primary school in Blangah Rise. They are familiar with the physical building and the routines. In addition, the primary school teachers make the effort to know the MK children before the start of the new school year.</p>
<p>This is what we do and believe in to give our children a STRONG START!</p>
