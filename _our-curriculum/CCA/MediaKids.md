<p>MediaKids is an extension of our <a href="https://blangahrisepri.moe.edu.sg/our-distinctive-programmes/young-photographers/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Young Photographers</a> programme,
where our students acquire advanced photography skills and work on school
publications. It is also a platform to develop 21st century competencies
in our students through leveraging photography to communicate their ideas.</p>
<p>As an opportunity to hone their photography skills, our MediaKids take
on the role of official photographers for school events and participate
in national competitions. Through these platforms, our MediaKids develop
their creativity, interpersonal skills and collaboration skills.</p>

<p>These are some of the composition techniques which our MediaKids have
learnt in photography. During their weekly CCA, they have the opportunity
to handle a DSLR, as well as learn about its functions and how each of
the functions is vital to capturing a good photograph. They extend their
skills in school&nbsp;through creative photography with props.</p>
<p>Carys, a Primary 4 student says, “We get to take photographs using the
DSLR, and learn about the different functions and buttons!”</p>
<p>Our MediaKids’ works are reviewed by their trainer, who gives them constructive
feedback on their photographs. This provides our MediaKids an insight on
what they did well and how they can improve in their photographs.</p>
<p>“I learn that sharing and reviewing each other’s work help us to become
better in our skills and techniques,” says Rishi, a Primary 4 student.</p>

<p>MediaKids also have the opportunity to hone their photography skills through
outdoor shoots at locations such as Telok Blangah Hill Park, Mount Faber,
HortPark, Labrador Nature Reserve, Fort Canning Park and Keppel Bay Bridge.
They apply composition techniques as such Rule of Thirds, Leading Lines
and Framing. Their works are proudly displayed at our photo gallery in
school and used in our publications! At the same time, MediaKids get to
learn more about the environment and explore environmental issues through
their lenses. “The outdoor shoots are a lot of fun. We get to compare composition
techniques and share ideas. We learn how each of us have different stories
in our photographs. Different people look at the same object differently,”
says Ka Shing, a Primary 5 student.</p>

<p>To commemorate the Singapore Bicentennial, MediaKids worked on a Bicentennial-themed
coffee table book, “Singapore Through Children’s Eyes” which was presented
to President Halimah Yacob on 28 July 2019. President Halimah had written
a foreword for the book, which was supported by the Singapore Bicentennial
Office. Click here&nbsp;<a href="/our-distinctive-programmes/special-projects/bicentennial-coffee-table-book/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">bicentennial coffee table book</a>&nbsp;to

<p>In line with the Tokyo Olympics, our students embarked on a project to
gather inspirational stories and messages from our local sportsmen and
sportswomen. In September 2019, we invited Singapore’s very own football
legend, Mr Fandi Ahmad to our school. Our MediaKids took photographs of
him being interviewed by our student leaders and conducting a football
clinic for our boys in the Football CCA group.</p>

<p>There were other platforms which gave our MediaKids opportunities to hone
their photography skills. In 2020, we met our nation’s World Number 1 Para
Archer, Ms Nur Syahidah Alim. Aqeel, our Primary 4 MediaKid, not only captured
the session through his lenses, but was also inspired to overcome challenges
and pursue his dreams and goals.</p>
<p>In celebration of Biodiversity Week from 19 to 26 May 2023, we produced
a coffee table book titled “A Bowl of Nature”. Our MediaKids applied their
photography skills and captured biodiversity through their lenses. Click

<p><strong>Photography Exhibition</strong>
</p>
<p>Titled Virtues of Creativity and Flexibility, this photograph was taken
at Labrador Nature Reserve by Ser Yen. It was selected to be exhibited
at the 18th Ngee Ann Photographic Exhibition for the Student Category.</p>
<p>Accompanying her photograph was a write-up: I like to experiment and try
new things. This is my first time capturing the landscape by using a lensball.
The landscape of Labrador Nature Reserve appears as an inverted image in
the lensball. This image resonates with me as it reminds me of being creative,
flexible and looking at things from different perspectives, especially
when we are facing difficulties.</p>

<p>For the 19th Ngee Ann Photographic Exhibition, Ser Yen has leveraged photography
to depict Virtues of Excellence and Determination. Out of 700 submissions,
Ser Yen’s photograph was one of the 158 photographs selected for exhibition.</p>
<p>Accompanying her photograph was a write-up: In our daily lives, we are
running a race to reach the finishing line, and striving to be the best
versions of ourselves. We should always put our best foot forward for excellence,
persevere whenever we encounter any challenges and not give up.</p>
<p>In our daily journey, we aim to reach our potential. In the process of
doing so, we face challenges with perseverance and determination. It is
crucial to always strive for excellence, never faltering in our efforts
to overcome obstacles and achieve our goals.</p>
<p>Ser Yen said, “Our CCA lessons are conducted by a professional photographer.
Through him, we learn more than just taking photographs. Our outdoor shoots
include understanding the environment and nature, and how our cameras can
capture how nature interacts.”</p>

<p>Mdm Uuchi, teacher in charge of MediaKids, shared “Through photography,
our students develop observation skills, artistic expression and a deeper
appreciation for the world around them. Our outdoor shoots are also very
hands-on, providing opportunities for our students to practise their photography
skills in real-world settings.”</p>
