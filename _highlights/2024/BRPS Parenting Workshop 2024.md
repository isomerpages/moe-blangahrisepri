<p>We organised a parenting workshop titled "Internet Addiction: How to Prevent
or Help Our Children Overcome It?", led by our Senior School Counsellor,
Madam Hung Mong Ping, and ICT Manager, Mr Urwin Ng. The workshop aimed
to equip parents with the necessary knowledge and tools to address the
growing concerns of internet addiction amongst children. By understanding
the impacts of excessive internet use, the school hopes that parent-participants
can implement effective strategies to foster healthier online habits in
their children.</p>
<p>A hands-on segment kick-started the evening as parents were guided through
the process of downloading and effectively using parental control apps
on their children’s mobile and online devices. These apps are designed
to monitor and limit screen time, ensuring their children engage in a balanced
range of activities.</p>
<p>The parenting workshop continued with the sharing on various facets of
internet addiction, including its psychological and social impacts. Parents
were strongly encouraged to put in place rules that are consistent and
be firm with boundaries set when it comes to using the Internet. The workshop
presenters also highlighted the importance of parents nurturing feelings
of warmth towards their children, and occupying their time with purposeful
activities so that they would not be too much of a reliance on their gadgets.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the presenters emphasised the importance of early intervention
and for parents to work closely with the school should the need arises.</p>
<p>The workshop concluded with small-group discussions focusing on how parents
can meet their children's fundamental needs. Parents and facilitators (members
of school’s key personnel team) shared strategies and personal experiences,
creating a supportive environment to learn from one another. This collaborative
approach underscored the importance of meeting these needs to prevent internet
addiction, promoting overall well-being and healthy home-school partnership.</p>
<p>The purposeful workshop provided valuable insights and practical tools
for parents, reinforcing the school's commitment to supporting the holistic
development of all students. We are also very grateful for the active participation
and positive feedback from parents who attended the workshop. We look forward
to organising such informative and beneficial sessions in the future.</p>
