<h4><strong>Learning Through Photography</strong></h4>
  
The Primary 2 students have been given a task – they need to apply photography skills to capture different shapes that they see at Telok Blangah neighbourhood. What did they use? A camera and knowledge on Shapes gleaned from their Mathematics lessons.

Kai Rou said, “Shapes are all around us. I have learnt to look at them closely and take photographs of them in different ways.”

Learning takes place beyond the classroom contexts. The Primary 3 students had the opportunity to capture leaves with different edges and plants with different colours and shapes at Singapore Botanic Gardens through their lenses. Aurelia shared, “I had learnt about plants during Science lessons in school and Student Learning Space (SLS). Learning was more exciting when I observed the plants at Singapore Botanic Gardens in real. I applied my knowledge from Science and took photographs of leaves with different edges.” Jay said, “I am looking forward to use my photographs to create classification charts in Google Classroom!”
In Young Photographers, students leverage the power of photography to achieve the 3Cs – Create, Communicate and Collaborate. 
To capture photographs that tell a story or a concept, students acquire photography skills and composition techniques such as rule of thirds, leading lines, framing and symmetry. Students acquire these composition techniques and outdoor shoot locations through Student Learning Space (SLS). This provides them with opportunities to be an active and self-directed learner.

All students attend face to face sessions and outdoor shoots in Young Photographers, which equip them with valuable skills to create and communicate stories through their lenses. Primary 2 and Primary 3 students build their proficiency using compact cameras. Primary 4 to Primary 6 students extend their skills through DSLR cameras.
After the outdoor shoots, students share compelling stories and perspectives through their own photographs. Our Primary 4 to Primary 6 students hone their English Language skills through photojournalism via our Viewpoints programme. This activity provides enriching learning opportunities by encouraging students to become active contributors and collaborate with one another. 
<h4><strong>Practice is Key</strong></h4>
<p>Students are given the opportunity to apply and practise photography skills through outdoor shoots at Telok Blangah Heights, Singapore Botanic Gardens, Gardens by the Bay – Flower Dome, Marina Barrage and Jurong Lake Gardens. They capture images based on the theme for each level. While doing so, students’ confidence in handling the cameras grows.</p>

<p>After the outdoor shoots, students share compelling stories and perspectives through their own photographs. There are many enriching learning opportunities. Primary 2 students practise using rich vocabulary to describe their photographs and share their thoughts. To extend their knowledge on plants, Primary 3 students create a classification chart to list the different plants’ edges. Primary 4 to Primary 6 students hone their English Language skills through photojournalism using Google Classroom –&nbsp;<a href="/viewpoints/">Viewpoints</a></p>

<h4><strong>Think Beyond What We See</strong></h4>

<p>Using the Thinking Routine See-Think-Wonder in SLS, students analyse photographs so as to generate possibilities, deepen their thinking and raise questions. Jayden, a P3 student, says “We have learnt to be more imaginative, explore different ideas and ask questions through See-Think-Wonder. We were then able to view things from different angles and apply our photography skills at the outdoor shoots.”</p>
