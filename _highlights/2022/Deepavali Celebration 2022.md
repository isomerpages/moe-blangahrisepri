<p>On 21 October 2022, our school hall came alive with the annual Deepavali celebrations. The celebrations kicked off with a graceful traditional dance item by Yogitha (6 Sapphire) and her sister Ruvanthigaa (4 Sapphire). This year’s celebrations focused on traditional musical instruments and our student emcees, Amelia (5 Topaz) and Devesh (5 Topaz), shared information on the different traditional Indian musical instruments such as “Nadhaswaram”, a double reed wind instrument from South India, and “Mridangam”, a percussion instrument of ancient origin. Our Primary two students then presented a wonder rendition of the Indian traditional musical art form called “Villupaattu”.</p>
<p>Our kindergarten friends also presented confidently in a video presentation, presenting different Indian traditional costumes that were worn during Deepavali. Through Amelia and Devesh’s presentation, we also learnt how Deepavali is celebrated in Singapore. For instance, a “Thoranam” is hung at the entrance of the house to symbolise a happy occasion. A “Kolam” is drawn outside the house to bring good luck to the family. Our creative parents from Parents Support Group (PSG) came together and designed a beautiful “Rangoli” made of colourful flower petals and rice powder. The decorations put up by our PSG certainly brings in the festive cheer!</p>
<p>The highlight of the concert was a dance item presented by our talented PSG. Our parents danced a mesmerising item to melodious traditional music. Shahan (4 Topaz) said, “I really enjoyed the dance performance and was excited to see parents performing too!”. Yizhien and Wei Ting (6 Topaz) shared the same sentiments. They were in awe that our parents were so talented and could dance so well.</p>
<p>Everyone had an enjoyable concert and we looked forward to next year’s celebration! To all who celebrate, Happy Deepavali!</p>
