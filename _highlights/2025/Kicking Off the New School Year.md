<p>We began the year with enthusiasm, welcoming our parents to a meaningful
workshop on the <em>7 Habits</em>, empowering families to support their
children’s growth both at school and at home. The workshop introduced <em>Habits 1-3</em> (Private
Victory) with engaging table discussions on how these habits can be practiced
at home. This was followed by <em>Habits 4-7</em> (Public Victory and Sharpening
the Saw), where parents crafted their <em>Family Mission Statement</em> and
made their first <em>Emotional Bank Account (EBA)</em> deposit.</p>

<p>Parents also enjoyed a guided tour of the school led by our confident
student leaders, showcasing the various facilities and learning experiences
at BRPS. They even got to observe their child’s recess, where students
were treated to healthy and delicious options like mashed potatoes with
meatballs and porridge. 🥔🍖🍚</p>
<p>Our students embraced their new routines, learning valuable self-management
skills, setting the stage for a successful year ahead. 📚🌟</p>
<p>💬 <em>Mdm Lam, a new parent, shared,</em> “Thank you, BRPS team, for organising
a meaningful workshop that brought parents together to learn more about
the <em>7 Habits</em> program. This valuable experience enabled us to understand
and align with the language and values the school uses to nurture our child.
We were especially proud to see the student leaders confidently guiding
us on a school tour, showcasing the various facilities and sharing the
diverse learning experiences that Blangahnites engage in. We deeply appreciate
the effort in creating such a thoughtful programme to warmly welcome us
and our child to BRPS on the first day of school.”</p>
