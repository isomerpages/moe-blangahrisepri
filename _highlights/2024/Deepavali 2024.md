<p>We celebrated Deepavali on 29 October, which saw the hall adorned with
vibrant lights, creating an atmosphere brimming with joy and happiness.
The event commenced with a light-up ceremony led by our School Leaders,
followed by an array of energetic dance performances by the students.</p>
<p>The celebration included a video introducing the origins of Deepavali
and a Classical Dance performance by Primary 2 students which captivated
the audience. Shanvitha from Primary 2 said, “I was so happy when I was
dancing. The cheering by the audience made me more confident while dancing.”</p>

<p>Aligned with our efforts to nurture confident speakers, the assembly programme
was presented by Kai Xiang and Natalie from Primary 5. They shared with
everyone on the Hindu customs and the observances during Deepavali.</p>
<p>They also enlightened us on how Deepavali is celebrated in Singapore.
They discussed the sweetmeats served during the festival and the morning
rituals.</p>
<p>Our MOE Kindergarten students brought the spirit of Deepavali to life
with a joyful dance performance! Dressed in colorful attire, they filled
the space with their lively moves and bright smiles.</p>

<p>The celebrations provided valuable insights into the importance of preserving
our culture and taking pride in our identity, serving as a beautiful platform
to usher in Deepavali. During the recess activities, we also organised
various Deepavali art and craft activities, allowing students to appreciate
the diversity in our multi-racial and multi-ethnic society.</p>
