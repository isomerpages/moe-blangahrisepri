<p>Congratulations to our Red Cross Links for achieving the Gold Excellent Unit Award for the year 2021! This is our thirteenth consecutive year achieving this award since 2009.</p>
<p>As a Uniformed Group, Red Cross brings together a team of passionate individuals committed to serving the school and the community for the greater good. We instill the values of self-discipline, order and teamwork to our links. Our links were engaged in a series of activities which created opportunities for our students to acquire lifesaving skills which include first aid skills. Through these activities, our links develop into leaders who promote the humanitarian values of the Red Cross. Our links continued to display a sense of global citizenship and to be socially responsible citizens.</p>
<p>This year is especially memorable as our links had to adapt and adhere to the Safety Management Measures. Despite the constraints, our links continued to display excellence and resilience.</p>
