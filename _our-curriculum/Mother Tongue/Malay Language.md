<p><strong>Department:&nbsp;</strong>Malay Unit (Mother Tongue Department)<br /><strong>Vision:&nbsp;</strong>Every child is able to use the Malay language effectively.<br /><strong>Mission:&nbsp;</strong>To nurture passion and love for the Malay language and the Malay culture in our students.</p>
<h4><strong>Description of Programmes:</strong></h4>
<p><strong><em>Teaching &amp; Learning<br /></em></strong>In our Malay Language classes, a variety of strategies are adopted to enhance our students&rsquo; learning and to provide them with opportunities to demonstrate thinking and communication skills. Students not only learn through textbooks but also through experiential learning in order to make learning valuable for students. For instance, Primary 2 students created their very own puppet just like what they learnt in their P2 Cekap textbook. On the other hand, our Primary 3 students applied their understanding of different language components through flashcards. In addition, during recess, our students also get to extend their learning by reading a storybook and doing a follow-up activity based on the storybook selected.</p>
