<p>As part of our ongoing effort to nurture 21st century competencies, we
were thrilled to send a group of 20 students and 5 teachers on a 4-day
overseas learning journey to Nanjing, China. The students were especially
excited to finally meet their pen pals in person. Upon arrival, the group
received a warm welcome from the staff and students of East Beijing Primary
School. During their time there, they participated in a variety of interactive
activities and had many opportunities to connect with peers from different
cultural backgrounds. Highlights of the visit included a storytelling session,
hands-on Chinese brush painting where they decorated handheld fans with
peony designs, and even some fun physical activities like rope skipping.</p>

<p>In addition, the students had the opportunity to visit several renowned
sites, including the Museum of Paleontology, where they learned about prehistoric
animals and even saw real dinosaur egg fossils. They also explored an insect
museum, where they deepened their understanding of various insect life
cycles and enjoyed close-up interactions with the insects themselves.</p>

<p>To further immerse themselves in China's rich history, the students visited
the Gate of China, where they admired the centuries-old architectural masterpiece.
They also explored the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, where they learned about
the life and contributions of Sun Yat-sen â€” a renowned physician, revolutionary
leader, statesman, and political thinker who founded the Republic of China.</p>
