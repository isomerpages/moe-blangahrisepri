Happy World Water Day 2023! This year's theme, "A Tale of a Hummingbird", reminds us that even the smallest actions can make a big difference in conserving our precious water resources. In the ancient tale, the hummingbird is faced with a great fire and, rather than stand and stare, decides to act - trying to put the fire out one drop at a time. The other animals laugh, but she replies, “I’m doing what I can.”

This year, we shared with our students about the importance of water conservation and how they can contribute to a sustainable future. Through fun and interactive activities, our students learnt about the water cycle, the impact of climate change on water resources, and practical tips for reducing water usage at home and in school. Students visited the Garden of Hope and learnt more about how our rainwater harvesting system helps to conserve water in our school. Let's all do our part in protecting this vital resource for generations to come!
