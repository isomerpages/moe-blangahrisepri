<p>Our school recently organised a Primary 4 Mother Tongue Language Camp
on 24th April for our Primary 4 students. This annual event aimed to deepen
their understanding of their respective Mother Tongue Languages, along
with their associated cultures and traditions. The camp also aimed to foster
the use of these Mother Tongue Languages in daily lives. Throughout the
camp, students engaged in a variety of activities designed to enhance their
language skills while exploring cultural elements and developing presentation
and communication abilities. These tailored experiences provided authentic
opportunities for students to use their Mother Tongue Languages beyond
the classroom, strengthening their connection to their cultural heritage.</p>

<p>Our students taking Malay Language explored the world of batik painting
and Gasing making. The batik painting experience introduced them to the
art and cultural significance of batik. They also learnt about Gasing,
a traditional Malay spinning top game. Mya found the batik painting experience
awe-inspiring, expressing a desire to continue exploring it in the future.
Danish enjoyed the thrill of spinning the top and testing his skills at
keeping it going.</p>

could keep it going.”</p>

place out of the classrooms!</p>
