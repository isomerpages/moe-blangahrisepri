Congratulations to our BRPS debate team! Our Senior Primary students – Gail, Athan, Nathanael, Hong Rian and Khush won against Ai Tong Primary School in Round 1 of Wits and Words 2023 Inter-school Debate Competition, on the motion of restricting school to 4-day week. Gail was also named the “Best Speaker” of that round.

In the second round, the team fought a close fight against our opponent, down to the last rebuttal point, on the issue of automation in healthcare. We would like to affirm all their efforts in the many weeks of intense research and preparation. All the best for the upcoming rounds!
