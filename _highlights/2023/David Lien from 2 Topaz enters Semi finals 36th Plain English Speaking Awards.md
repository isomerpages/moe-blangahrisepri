We are thrilled to shine a spotlight on one of our students, David Lien from Primary 2 Topaz, who proudly represented our school in the 36th Plain English Speaking Awards (PESA). David's journey in the PESA led him to the Semi-finals, where he demonstrated exceptional public speaking skills with confidence. While his journey ended at the Semi-finals, David's achievements are a testament to his dedication and hard work.

David shared his reflections on his PESA experience, highlighting the joy he found in learning new skills and practicing public speaking. "PESA was fun because I enjoyed learning new skills like public speaking," David shared. He openly acknowledged the nerves he felt, particularly because he had never spoken on a stage before. However, as he continuously practised for his speech, David noticed a remarkable transformation within himself, saying, "I have never spoken on a stage before, so I was very nervous, but I also became more confident through this process."

David also extended his heartfelt gratitude to those who supported and guided him throughout his PESA journey. He expressed his appreciation for his parents and Ms. Esther, who played a significant role in his preparation, teaching him valuable skills and providing guidance, and for their unwavering support and encouragement.

As David concludes his PESA journey for this year, he looks forward to the future with renewed enthusiasm. He expressed his eagerness to join PESA again next year, armed with newfound confidence and the invaluable experiences he gained.

David Lien's journey in the 36th PESA is a testament to the power of determination and the joy of learning. We congratulate David on his achievements and eagerly anticipate his continued growth!
