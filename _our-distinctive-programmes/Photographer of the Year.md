<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Photographer of the Year 2021</strong></h2>
<p>We organised our first photography competition this year &ndash; Photographer of the Year. The theme for this competition is &ldquo;Home&rdquo;. This is a platform for our students to define what &ldquo;Home&rdquo; mean to them, and to extend their photography skills gleaned from our distinctive programme, Young Photographers.</p>
<p>Through the competition, we aim to engage our students in self-directed learning through brainstorming of ideas, extending photography composition techniques knowledge through Student Learning Space (SLS). Students can also synergise their creative skills, photography skills, and writing skills to interpret the theme &ldquo;Home&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Check out our students&rsquo; Best Photo Story and Honourable Mention pieces.</p>

<p>My photograph, which shows how a spider has formed a web in my neighbourhood, showcases the given theme of "home". It can be interpreted in a negative way that our homes are often neglected because everyone is so busy with school and work and not spending enough time to notice many things. It can also be viewed in a positive way where the environment we live in is peaceful enough for a living creature to make their own homes among us. With the current pandemic situation, we stay home much more and spend more time with our families and notice more nature and everything around us. We can use this time to appreciate our home and respect the homes of others by being responsible and good human beings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Buildings, Plants, The sunshine. It reminds me of my beautiful home. Different colours and different shades of the sunshine represents the shelter that is covering us. Different houses with their own unique decorations and plants remind me of how diverse our culture can be. It reminds me that if we work together as one, we will fight the pandemic and gain freedom. It also reminds me that if we tell ourselves that the day is awesome, the day will be just as awesome as the different shades and colours and culture. I love my home!</p>

<p>Lights up&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the night falls, everyone goes back to their warm home and reunite with their loved ones. You can see their lights go up and different coloured lights fill up the building with joy. It makes me think of the different races contributing together to make our nation stronger and brighter. I used the Rule of Thirds technique in taking this photo.</p>

<p>A home is a place where we used to play and relax. But after Covid-19, a home is where you work, play, and relax all at the same time. People now can bond better at home, with work a few steps away.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The blue sky and the greenery from the trees represents Singapore as people call Singapore a Garden City.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This is our home where we stay, live, work, study and play.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>&nbsp;Honourable Mention</strong></h3>

<p>I was inspired by F-15SG. I built this out of Lego pieces. It took me one hour to build this. F-15SG is used by the Singapore Air Force to protect our homes and nation from any air threats. It keeps our homes safe. In the future, I hope to see the F-15SG in real life.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>2 Sapphire</strong></p>
<p>I used the composition technique of leading lines to present my photograph with the theme "My home". Everyone needs a home. We need a home, even animals need a home. Home is a safe and comfortable place where we live in, where we can play and sleep well. Just like the picture, Kazuki (the dog) shows you how comfortable his home is and where he feels safe.</p>

<p>I took this photograph lying down on the playground. I used the Leading Lines technique for my photograph. My photograph is of the HDB flats in my neighbourhood. It showcases the theme Home because this is where my neighbours and I live and play together.</p>

<p>My photo has two monkeys. One is on the branch and the other monkey is on the grass. I picked this photo because these monkeys are commonly found in Singapore. They are found in parks and forests, which are home for the monkeys. We cannot litter or throw things at the monkeys. We have to respect their homes and keep them safe.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Home is where your heart is. Where you can be yourself, feel safe and secure. Home is where family members eat together, sleep together, and laugh together. There is just no other place like home!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>2 Opal</strong></p>
<p>This photo is like 'Home' to me. The playground has something that reminds me of the Japanese torii. This Japanese torii is in the Singapore Garden City. As I am half Japanese and half Singaporean-Malay, the torii is something that my Daddy showed me before of Japan. I looked at lines and patterns to take the photo.</p>

<p>The nest is home for birds and little ones to sleep and rest. The birds built nest to protect their little ones. It is a place where the little ones feel safe. Similarly, our parents and teachers make our homes and school a safe place. Let us thank them for nurturing us too.</p>

<p>Singapore is a garden city. It's relaxing when I walk past this green area on the way to school everyday. I love that Singapore has a lot of greenery which makes our environment beautiful. Seeing the trees make me feels relaxed and it is like I am at home.</p>

<p>I am very happy today. I baked cookies with my Mum at home. I enjoy spending time with my family at home. I used the Rule of thirds and patterns in my photograph.</p>

<p>This is the night view taken at the corridor. It was a very dark night. I could still see the beautiful lights from my home. I love my home because it has a very nice view and I get to create many special memories with my family.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>CHEN XINBO MILLS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>3 Opal</strong></p>
<p>This photograph reminds me of how warm it is. Home is a very important thing to us because if we do not have a home, we will not live very well and we would starve if we cannot find food. Home is where I like to be.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>4 Sapphire</strong></p>
<p>The photograph I submitted was taken from my bedroom window during National Day. I was so proud to see the Singapore flag flying on a military helicopter right outside my window. After living overseas for many years, it is good to be back in my home country where I feel safe and protected. The helicopter and the flag makes me have a feeling of safety, peace and happiness. This is why I like living in Singapore, because of the great security that makes my parents less worried when I go out by myself and the beautiful country it is.</p>

<p>Even during the COVID-19 pandemic period, the lights are shining brightly for visitors to Gardens by the Bay and other viewers. This is our "Home" shining brightly like a beacon in the sky. Whether people are on staycation or if the rooms are simply lit as a sign of beauty, it reminds me of when Singapore was full of tourists.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the picture of the national flag hung by the helicopters during the NDP. I have used the rule of thirds in this picture. This picture symbolizes pride. Singapore is my home and always will be.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">This is the view from my home.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">During this pandemic where we are mostly at home, this view gives me comfort.</p>
