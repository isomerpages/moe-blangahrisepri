<p>Our Primary 3 to 6 students recently put their STEM skills to the test
with an exciting challenge inspired by the James Dyson Foundation: building
boats powered by a chemical reaction. This hands-on project allowed students
to explore the principles of chemical reactions and propulsion using simple
materials like bottles, vinegar, and bicarbonate of soda.</p>
<p>An impressive 80% of our participating students successfully completed
the challenge, demonstrating MOE's 21st Century Competencies (21CC) like
adaptive and inventive thinking. Students had to troubleshoot design flaws,
adjust their methods, and think creatively to optimise their boat's performance.
Students collaborated effectively, sharing ideas and working together to
overcome obstacles â€“ an affirmation to their growing collaboration skills.</p>
<p>This challenge provided a valuable opportunity for our students to apply
scientific concepts in a real-world context, fostering a deeper understanding
of how chemical reactions can generate energy and motion.</p>
<p>To see our students in action and show your support for their amazing
efforts, please like this<strong> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DH-kElYtRX4/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><u>reel</u></a></strong>.</p>
<p>Congratulations to all our young scientists and engineers for their hard
work and success!</p>
