<p>The Primary 4 students went on a learning journey to the Road Safety Community
Park at East Coast on Friday, 26 July, to take part in the Traffic Games.
The latter is designed to instill critical life skills, such as understanding
traffic signals, the importance of road signs, and how to behave responsibly
in different traffic situations.</p>
<p>This learning journey offered a dynamic and interactive approach to road
safety education, allowing students to engage in hands-on experiences that
make learning both enjoyable and memorable. At the park, the students had
the opportunity to role-play as pedestrians, cyclists, motorists in go-karts
and road marshals. They were immersed in real-life traffic scenarios, learning
essential road safety rules in a controlled environment.</p>
<p>Seo Jun from 4 Topaz was selected to be a cyclist. He shared that through
the missions that he had to complete, he learnt that he had to be patient
and control the speed of the bicycle so that he would not get into accidents.</p>
<p>Henry from 4 Opal, said, “It was my first time in a go-kart. I felt like
I was driving a car. I had to follow the traffic rules closely so that
I would not get any demerit points.”</p>
<p>Po-Wei from 4 Topaz, was a road marshal. His role was to ensure that the
road users followed the traffic rules. He reflected that most of his schoolmates
did do the kerb drill before crossing the road. He enjoyed the experience
and am now more aware of the traffic rules.</p>
<p>Clara from 4 Sapphire, was selected to be a pedestrian. She shared that
she had fun at the park and at the same time, she was more aware of the
road safety rules.</p>
<p>This learning journey was an invaluable step towards fostering responsible
and safety-conscious road users.</p>
