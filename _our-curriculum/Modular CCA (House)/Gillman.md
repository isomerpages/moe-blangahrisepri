---
<p>Gillman Barracks has a very rich military history in Singapore. It housed the British Army and later SAF Combat Engineers. Staying relevant with the times, Gillman Barracks is now a visual arts hub that celebrates creativity and contemporary art.</p>
<p>Gillman House embodies<br /><strong>Purposefulness:</strong>&nbsp;Begin with a vision and have a clear focus of what we want to accomplish just like&nbsp;the design of Gillman Barracks as a large neighbourhood with living quarters, social and recreational activities for communal living.<br /><strong>Moderation:</strong>&nbsp;Create a healthy balance between work and play just like the soldiers who trained hard and yet prioritised pockets of time to exercise and rest.<br /><strong>Flexibility:</strong>&nbsp;Open to change just like the redevelopment of Gillman Barracks over time from an army barracks to an arts hub.</p>
