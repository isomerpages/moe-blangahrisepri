<p><strong>Vision:&nbsp;</strong>Every child is imbued with a life-long curiosity and love for Science.<br><strong>Mission:&nbsp;</strong>To develop the innovative and creative spirit in every child.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>To effectively learn science, students need to learn more than just facts and theories. Rather, they need to construct their understanding through an iterative, collaborative process that builds and reshapes prior knowledge.</em></p>

<p><strong>Scientific Inquiry and Scientific Method</strong><br>Scientific inquiry is defined as the activities and processes which scientists and students engage in to study the natural and physical world around us. We believe that teaching the scientific method to students is to teach them how to think critically, learn, solve problems, and make informed decisions. These skills are integral to every aspect of a student&rsquo;s education and life. As our students grow up in an increasingly technologically and scientifically advanced world, we give our students the knowledge and skills to be scientifically literate to thrive in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Description of Programmes:<br /></strong>We put together a suite of Science programmes with the aim of providing students with experiences to nurture students to have a curious and rational mind, a loving heart, and an innovative spirit.</p>
<p><strong>Inquiry-based Learning using Science Kits<br /></strong>The use of science kits in the science classroom changes teacher and student roles. It alters learning environment by moving instruction away from more didactic, teacher-centered forms to more hands-on, student-centered forms. These kits serve as effective classroom tools to support hands-on curriculum supplements. The main objective is to engage all students in active, meaningful learning where learning is associated with hands-on instructional strategies.</p>
