<p>On 27 March, we were happy to meet students and teachers from S.K.H Tin
Shui Wai Ling Oi Primary School, Hong Kong. Our Primary 4 students had
a great time with their new-found friends. Together, they went through
Physical Education lessons and had fun together. It was heartwarming to
see bonds formed between the students and how they worked together to enjoy
Physical Education lessons and communicate effectively despite their cultural
differences. Mahasina from Primary 4 shared that she enjoyed playing sports
with her new friend and she had the opportunity to learn more about Hong
Kong.</p>

<p>During the recess experience, our students brought their friends along
for recess play. Some of our students even brought their friends from Hong
Kong around the school to learn about the different places in our learning
environment.</p>

<p>During the exchange, they gave each other gifts which represented their
own culture as a memento. Carys from Primary 4 shared that she also enjoyed
making new friends and found the experience to be a meaningful one. She
hoped to participate in similar activities in the future.</p>

<p>Our international school collaborations not only provide students with
opportunities to learn about different cultures but also help them develop
valuable interpersonal skills and global perspectives.</p>
<p>It was fantastic to see that the students were eager to participate in
such meaningful experiences and were opened to forming friendships across
borders!</p>
