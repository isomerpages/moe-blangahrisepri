<p>Eunice, Evana and Jovan, age 12, got to express their artistic talent and creative voice at the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) 2019 celebrations! They were specially selected by MOE based on photographs they had taken previously, and received mentoring by a professional photographer through a masterclass format. They then applied their learning in an authentic way through capturing photographic and iconic moments for SYF celebrations in the community held at Bukit Panjang Plaza on&nbsp;7 July 2019. They also had the privilege of sharing what they were doing with Mr Ang Wei Neng, Member of Parliament for Jurong GRC. Well done, Eunice, Evana and Jovan!</p>
