<p>MediaKids is an extension of our Young Photographers programme, where our students acquire advanced photography skills and work on school publications.</p>
<p>As an opportunity to hone their photography skills, our MediaKids take on the role of official photographer for school events and participate in national competitions. Through these platforms, our MediaKids develop their creativity, interpersonal skills and collaboration skills.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Besides the Rule of Thirds, I have learnt a new composition technique - Leading Lines! I am able to draw viewers&rsquo; attention to lines that lead to the main subject of my photograph,&rdquo; says Qanitah, a Primary 6 student.</p>
<p>These are some of the composition techniques which our MediaKids have learnt in photography. During their weekly CCA, they have the opportunity to handle a DSLR, as well as learn about its functions and how each of the functions is vital to capturing a good photograph. They extend their skills in school&nbsp;through creative photography with props.</p>

<p>MediaKids also have the opportunity to hone their photography skills through outdoor shoots at locations such as&nbsp;Telok Blangah Hill Park and Mount Faber. They apply composition techniques as such Rule of Thirds, Leading Lines and Framing. Their works are proudly displayed at our photo gallery in school and used in our publications! At the same time, MediaKids&nbsp;get to learn more about the environment and explore environmental issues through their lenses.</p>

<p>To commemorate the Singapore Bicentennial, MediaKids worked on a Bicentennial-themed coffee table book, &ldquo;Singapore Through Children&rsquo;s Eyes&rdquo; which was presented to President Halimah Yacob on 28 July 2019. President Halimah had written a foreword for the book, which was supported by the Singapore Bicentennial Office.

<p>In line with the upcoming Tokyo Olympics, our students embarked on a project to gather inspirational stories and messages from our local sportsmen and sportswomen. In September 2019, we invited Singapore&rsquo;s very own football legend, Mr Fandi Ahmad to our school. Our MediaKids took photographs of him being interviewed by our student leaders and conducting a football clinic for our boys in the Football CCA group.</p>

<p>There were other platforms which gave our MediaKids opportunities to hone their photography skills. In 2020, we met our nation&rsquo;s World Number 1 Para Archer, Ms Nur Syahidah Alim. Aqeel, our Primary 4 MediaKid, not only captured the session through his lenses, but was also inspired to overcome challenges and pursue his dreams and goals.</p>

<p>Ms Ho, teacher in charge of MediaKids, shared, "I can see our MediaKids growing in confidence as they collaborate with one another to capture special moments during school and community events. One of the most memorable moments for me was when I saw them in action as student photographers during the SYF Celebrations. It was a proud moment to see them step out of their comfort zones in an unfamiliar environment and apply the photography skills that they have acquired.&rdquo;
