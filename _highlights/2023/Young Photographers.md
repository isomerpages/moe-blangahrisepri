“Place your subject in the left or right third on your screen and leave two thirds or more open. Use the gridlines to help you,” said the photography instructor. Our Primary 2 students were introduced to photography, beginning with the composition technique – Rule of Thirds. They had the opportunity to apply this composition technique to capture different shapes that they see at Telok Blangah neighbourhood. Kai Xuan from 2 Topaz said, “Shapes are all around us. I have learnt to look at them closely and take photographs of them in different ways.”

Our Primary 3 students build up their compact camera skills gleaned from the previous year through acquiring more advanced composition techniques such as the use of patterns. They had the opportunity to capture leaves with different edges and plants with different colours and shapes at Singapore Botanic Gardens through their lenses.

Aurelia shared, “I learnt about plants during Science lessons in school and on Student Learning Space (SLS). Learning got more exciting when I observed the plants at Singapore Botanic Gardens in real. I applied my knowledge from Science and took photographs of leaves with different edges.”

Our Primary 4 students learnt composition techniques such as layering and leading lines using the DSLR camera and applied their skills at Gardens by The Bay – Flower Dome. They were able to observe the different colours and shapes of flowers and plants in real life as compared to images found in textbooks and videos. 
Dave from 4 Topaz shared, “Young Photographers was very enjoyable and interactive. It was my first time using a DSLR! I learnt new composition techniques such as layering and framing. We saw and learnt about some exotic flowers and plants which we had never seen before.”

Our Primary 5 students went to Marina Barrage for their outdoor shoot. They had learnt about the threefold benefits of the location and its importance to Singapore. Just like the other levels, they applied photography skills gleaned to capture the beauty of Marina Barrage.

After the outdoor shoots, students share compelling stories and perspectives through their own photographs. Our Primary 4 and 5 students honed their English Language skills through photojournalism via our Viewpoints programme. This activity provided enriching learning opportunities for students to pen a personal response to the photographs they have taken.

MediaKids CCA, an extension of our Young Photographers, is a platform for students to acquire advanced photography skills. Ser Yen’s photograph, titled “Virtues of Creativity and Flexibility”, was selected by the organiser to be displayed at the 18th Ngee Ann Photographic Exhibition 2023. The photograph was also selected to be a permanent collection by the organizer, a true affirmation Ser Yen’s photography skills. Ser Yen’s photograph is also featured in our latest publication [A Bowl of Nature](https://www.blangahrisepri.moe.edu.sg/special-projects/a-bowl-of-nature/)

Our Primary 6 students will be acquiring advanced DSLR skills and they will head to Jurong Lake Gardens for their outdoor shoot. Do keep a lookout for them!
From our Young Photographers programme, we can truly see that “A picture paints a thousand words” where rich learning takes place beyond the classroom walls.
