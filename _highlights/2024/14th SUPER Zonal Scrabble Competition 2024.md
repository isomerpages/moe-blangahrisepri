<p><strong>14th SUPER Zonal Scrabble Competition 2024</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our students showcased their English language skills at the 14th SUPER
Zonal Scrabble Competition 2024. This competition provided an excellent
opportunity for students to apply vocabulary, spelling, and strategic thinking
in an engaging and competitive environment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are incredibly proud to announce that our students emerged as the South
Zone Champions in the Junior Division! Their dedication, hard work, and
passion for learning were rewarded with this well-deserved victory, making
our school proud.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through this experience, the students not only honed their language skills
but also developed critical thinking, teamwork, and perseveranceâ€”skills
that will benefit them well beyond the classroom. Congratulations to our
champions for an outstanding achievement!</p>
