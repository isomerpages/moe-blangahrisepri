Did you know that Blangah Rise Primary School offers an innovative School Meals Programme? Unlike a traditional school canteen which operates a few stalls, SATS, Asiaâ€™s leading airline caterer provides healthy and nutritious school meals for our students, catering to various tastes and nutritional needs. Award-winning chefs and professional dieticians curate the menu each term, ensuring a wide range of healthy choices. SATS prioritizes food safety and quality, following strict standards, sourcing reliable ingredients, and using hygienic facilities. Our parents appreciate the ability to track and educate their children about meals' nutritional value online.
