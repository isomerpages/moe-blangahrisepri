<p>Blangah Rise had celebrated Lunar New Year on 20 January. This year was very special as the whole school could finally gather and celebrate the festival after two years of online activities. Our confident emcees, Catherine and Ameer (both from 5 Sapphire) took us through the entire concert.</p>
<p>The festive occasion started off with our teachers sharing about the taboos of the Lunar New Year. Thereafter, Lucas and Rayyan (both from P6 Sapphire) put on their mini lion heads and performed a lion dance to usher in the festivity.</p>
<p>Do you know that the Koreans wear the “Hanbok” during the Korean New Year, “Seollal” and Vietnamese wear the “áo dài” a traditional Vietnamese national garment during New Year, also known as Tết Nguyên Đán? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Our students from different parts of the world put on their traditional costumes and shared about the different costumes they would wear to celebrate the new year. We were in awe of the beautiful designs on the costumes worn by our students.</p>
<p>Following that, our friends from MOE Kindergarten presented a dance item “New Year Song Medley”. They danced to the tune of various Chinese New Year songs. Our Primary Four students and teachers also presented an Allegro performance, using bamboo clappers, wishing everyone a joyous Lunar New Year.</p>
<p>Everyone had fun when Miss Seow and Miss Anjanaa engaged them in a game segment “Passing Game”. It brought about lots of laughter and excitement!</p>
<p>Mr Leow led the whole school in an exercise activity where everyone moved to the beats of “Huo Yuan Jia”. It was a spectacular sight, seeing the whole school working out together. Our students and teachers also sang along in various melodious Lunar New Year songs.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the concert, our students practised the virtue of respect as they presented mandarin oranges and well-wishes to our teachers.</p>
<p>We wish everyone a Happy New Year! 新年快乐，万事如意！</p>
