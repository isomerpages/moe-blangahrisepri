<p>During the September school holiday, four teams from Blangah Rise Primary
School participated in the prestigious World Robotics Olympiad (WRO) 2024,
an event that challenges young innovators to solve real-world problems
through robotics and technology.</p>
<p>The theme for this year's competition was "Earth Allies," and students
were tasked with developing robots that could help people live in harmony
with nature. The WRO encourages students to consider the delicate balance
between human progress and the power of the natural world. It highlights
the reality that while we cannot control nature, we can innovate ways to
co-exist peacefully and even thrive in its presence. The challenge invited
students to explore how robots can help us predict, mitigate and recover
from natural disasters, ensuring the safety and resilience of our communities.</p>
<p>Among our teams, the “Earthquake Detectors” distinguished themselves by
winning the Judges' Award. Their project focused on developing an innovative
solution to detect early signs of earthquakes, aiming to enhance safety
and response times in disaster-prone areas. By integrating advanced sensors
and programming, their model effectively identified seismic activity, alerting
communities before a major quake could strike. The judges commended their
creativity, technical skills and the potential impact of their project
on real-world safety.</p>
<p>Throughout their participation, the students demonstrated critical 21st
Century Competencies, particularly in inventive thinking, communication
and civic literacy. They applied inventive thinking to solutions for disaster
prevention, communicated their ideas effectively through presentations
and collaboration and exhibited civic literacy by addressing the needs
of disaster-prone communities and contributing to societal well-being.</p>
<p>This accolade reflects the hard work, dedication and teamwork of our students.
Congratulations to all our participants and a special commendation to the
Earthquake Detectors for their outstanding achievement on the world stage!</p>
