SG Clean Day, a day dedicated to raising awareness of keeping our physical environment clean, was commemorated on 9 May 2023 at Blangah Rise Primary School.  
  
Our Primary 4 and 5 students had the opportunity to work with their hands to learn what it takes to keep places in Singapore cleans. Primary 4 Blangahnites went around the school to clean up commonly used play areas such as the basketball court, the school field, and the Indoor Sports Hall. Primary 5 Blangahnites went out into the Telok Blangah neighbourhood to help sweep up dried and fallen leaves for tree mulching. These leaves were then used for tree mulching in our school gardens. Tere Mulching is a gardening technique where dried leaves and other compost are placed around the tree to provide nutrients.  
  
“Green words like repurposing and creating wastes into treasure came to mind while I collected the dried leaves,” shared Khush, a Primary 5 student. Natasha, another Primary 5 student, exclaimed, "This is a meaningful activity. I can't wait to do this again!"

Mr Patrick Goh, Year Head for Middle Primary, noted how this activity helped the students empathize with those who help clean our environment daily. He said, "Going out into the community to serve helps our young understand the impact and consequences of litter. This experience has nurtured them to be ambassadors for cleanliness".   

  

Let's all take heed from Jayden, our Primary 4 student, who shared with certitude, "Cleanliness is a virtue. Let's all do our part!".
