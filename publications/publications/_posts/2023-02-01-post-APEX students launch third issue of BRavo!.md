As part of the English Department's aim to give students a voice to share their thoughts and views through writing, we welcome the third edition of BRavo!, a publication by students for students. Over several months of meetings, our budding writers in the APEX-EL Writing Programme had fun stretching their imagination and writing potential to put this newsletter together. This issue comprises a collection of our students' creative and journalistic works. We hope you enjoy reading it.
