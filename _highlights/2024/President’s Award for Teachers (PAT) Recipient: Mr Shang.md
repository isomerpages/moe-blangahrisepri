<p>Congratulations to Mr Shang Thian Huat for receiving the PAT 2024! PAT
recognises excellent educators for their role in moulding the future of
our nation. Mr Shang was one of the eight educators who received the PAT
2024 from President Tharman Shanmugaratnam during the Teachers’ Day Reception
held on 29 August 2024.</p>
<p>To Mr Shang, sports is more than just about fitness. He inspires students
to lead active lives and give back to the community. Collaborating with
community partners, Mr Shang introduced a school-wide Values-in-Action
(VIA) programme focused on active aging and intergenerational bonding.
Each month, students from different CCAs organise sports and games for
senior citizens in Telok Blangah, building bonds with the elderly while
learning empathy, patience, and teamwork through sports.</p>
<p>Phua Ser Yen, a Student Leader, shared her heartfelt thoughts at the Teachers’
Day Reception.</p>
<p><em>“Mr Shang taught me to be wise, to be responsible and stay on the right path. He recognised my leadership qualities and encouraged me to grow as a leader even when I leave primary school.</em>
</p>
<p><em>Mr Shang taught us that sports is more than just about fitness. He started a really interesting Values-in-Action programme. In this programme, students will take turns to organise sports and games for the senior citizens in Telok Blangah. I cannot wait to be a part of this programme next term and teach the elderly how to play modified floorball. It is going to be fun and I look forward to connecting with our seniors as I think I can learn a lot from them.</em>
</p>
<p><em>Thank you, Mr Shang, for your listening ear, guidance and support, and for teaching me to serve the community.”</em>
</p>
<p>Through his practices and actions, Mr Shang is indeed an inspiration to
our students and colleagues!</p>
