Our school kicked off the month of August on a celebratory mood with the commemoration of EAS Day 2023. This annual event honours our school’s non-teaching staff for their invaluable dedication and contributions to our school. Our EAS team includes Executive and Administrative Staff, Cleanliness Officers, Security Officers, Operations Support Officers and School Support Staff. The work that they do support the smooth operations at our school on a daily basis.

Our prefects supported the teachers in the planning and organising of the special occasion. This year, students from the Art Club contributed to the commemoration by designing tote bags as part of a care pack that was gifted to all non-teaching staff. In addition, our principal, Mr Francis Foo, presented Certificates of Appreciation to the attendees. Event host, Mills from Primary 5, reflected, “The non-teaching staff plays a key role in ensuring that the school is managed efficiently. They truly deserve a special day which celebrates their heart and hard work!”

The celebrations went up a notch with a special appearance of Singapore’s National Day mascot, August! Together with students from the Dance Club, August led the school, MOE Kindergarten students included, to the rhythmic moves of this year’s National Day theme song, Shine Your Light.

The finale, once again, highlighted the main purpose of EAS Day as Shahan from Primary 5 dedicated a poem – Thank You! – to the non-teaching staff. Administration Officer, Mdm Nelita shared, “I feel grateful to the students and staff for their act of appreciation to acknowledge the contributions of the non-teaching staff.”
