The annual P6 Motivation Camp was planned to help our graduating cohort heighten their level of self-motivation, self-confidence, and to create opportunities for them to build camaraderie with their peers.

On the first day of the camp, students brainstormed ideas that combined the principles of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) to design and create their very own solar oven. After their group discussions, students were given time to build their own prototype using recycled materials. Despite the sweltering heat, our students persevered by working together to test the effectiveness of their solar oven by using it to successfully melt a bar of chocolate.

Lucas from 6 Sapphire shared, “I had a lot of fun building the solar oven with my friends. I was surprised that the temperature of the box could rise to 60 degrees Celsius. I was even more excited to eat the melted chocolate at the end of the activity!”

The Motivation Camp was definitely an enriching learning experience for our P6 students.

On the second day of the camp, students went through a series of team building activities that involved group discussions, collaborative exercises and leadership training. All these activities aim to help our students learn new skills through synergy, increase their self-confidence and build stronger rapport with one another. Nathan of 6 Topaz shared, “I was pleasantly surprised to see my group supporting each other through the different games. They were not the usual group I work with and I got a chance to bond with different people in the level. Teamwork made it possible for us to achieve the goals even when some of the challenges were tough! I had a really fun time.”
