<p>On 5 August 2025, our school came together to celebrate <strong>EAS Day: Our Everyday Heroes</strong>,
honouring the invaluable contributions of our Executive and Administrative
Staff (EAS) – who work tirelessly behind the scenes to keep our school
running smoothly. The celebration began with a special assembly programme,
followed by heartfelt gestures of appreciation from teachers and students.</p>

<p>In the lead-up to the event, teachers penned personalised thank-you cards,
filling them with messages of gratitude that brought smiles to the faces
of our EAS colleagues.</p>

<p>After school, our EAS staff enjoyed a prefect-led wellness activity –
a relaxing and creative Perler bead art session. This hands-on activity
gave them the chance to craft colourful pixel-style designs, enjoy a calming
break, and express their creativity together. Madam Nasopa, our laboratory
assistant, remarked, "I really enjoyed the wellness activity after school.
We took part in a Perler bead art activity where we got to create our favourite
icons. I enjoyed the whole process of placing the beads one by one till
I got my desired image."</p>

<p>The day was a warm reminder of the importance of recognising and valuing
every member of our BRPS family, and it strengthened the bonds that make
our school community so special. Kai Ting of P5 Topaz reflected aptly that,
“It was meaningful to see the EAS staff enjoying themselves. Activities
like these help us show appreciation for their hard work and remind us
to value their contributions every day.”</p>
