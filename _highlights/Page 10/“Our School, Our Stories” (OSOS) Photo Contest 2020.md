<p>Congratulations to Wunna and Yu Hong who have won the Honourable Mention for their entry &ldquo;We Love Bentos!&rdquo; in &ldquo;Our School, Our Stories&rdquo; (OSOS) photo contest 2020! Their photo story was based on the theme &ldquo;Priceless Moments&rdquo; which captured the experiences of our Primary 1 students enjoying their recess bentos and even creating their own healthy and tasty bentos. You&nbsp;may&nbsp;view the photos at the roving&nbsp;OSOS&nbsp;exhibition (nearest location: 23 Jalan Membina, near Tiong Bahru MRT Station, from 13 Nov to 3 Dec 2020).</p>
