<p>Our year-end celebration was a beautiful reflection of what happens when
confidence, teamwork and passion come together. From the harmonious voices
of our choir to the vibrant energy of our dancers, and the energetic Primary
6 showcase with house flags and sports demonstrations, every act lit up
the stage in its own special way.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>This year’s theme, “Together We Shine,” came alive as our students supported
one another, encouraged their peers and gave their best on stage. Beyond
the performances, what truly shone was their passion, dedication and sense
of togetherness.
<br>
<br>A heartfelt thank you to our teachers for their guidance, our parents
for their unwavering support, and our students for filling the hall with
joy and pride. We end the year with full hearts and wonderful memories.&nbsp;
