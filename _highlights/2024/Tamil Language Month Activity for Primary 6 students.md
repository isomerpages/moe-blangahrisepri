Our Primary 6 Tamil Language students had the opportunity to attend a Tamil Language Workshop on 16 April 2024. The workshop was organised in conjunction with Tamil Language month which takes place in April every year. This year, we were excited to invite Mr Raguvaran to conduct the workshop for our students. 

Mr Raguvaran is a popular television personality. He is also an experienced theatre performer and has conducted many interesting workshops for children. One highlight of the workshop was the incorporation of role-playing activities that set an authentic communication scenario.

Isabel said, “We had so much fun acting out different parts! It felt like playing games while we were learning the Tamil Language." 

Mr Raguvaran also demonstrated interactive exercises to improve conversational skills. He created a comfortable environment for dialogue, boosting students’ confidence in speaking Tamil. The workshop offered students the platform for conversational practice, encouraging them to express themselves in Tamil Language. 

Ruvanthigaa shared, “These exercises provided us with practical opportunities to apply our language skills, ultimately improving our ability to communicate effectively in Tamil Language.”

Mr Raguvaran’s focus on pronunciation, conversational practice, and constructive feedback was instrumental in helping students develop as proficient Tamil Language speakers. 

We look forward to more future opportunities for students to learn from Mr Raguvaran.
