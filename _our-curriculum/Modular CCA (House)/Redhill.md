<p>Redhill got its name from the folkfore of a brave boy&rsquo;s brilliant idea that saved an entire village from swordfish attack. Redhill estate is also one of Singapore&rsquo;s oldest and was a venue of the decentralized National Day Parades from 1975 to 1983.</p>
<p>Redhill embodies<br><strong>Purposefulness:</strong>&nbsp;Being purposeful gives direction in our lives which leads to fulfilment and meaningfulness.<br><strong>Thankfulness:</strong>&nbsp;The heart that gives thanks is a happy one.<br><strong>Empathy:</strong>&nbsp;See with the eyes, listen with the ears and feel with the heart of another. See the light and be the light for each other.</p>
<p>Mohamed Shahan (3 Topaz, Redhill)<br><em>&ldquo;I like Modular CCA (House) because I can do my homework before participating in sports and games. This is good because I can finish my homework in school. I like my House teachers and friends.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
