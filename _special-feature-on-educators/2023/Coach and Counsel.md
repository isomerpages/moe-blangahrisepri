<h3>Coach and Counsel</h3>
<p>Miss Teo Mui Li has a teaching philosophy centered around two core principles:
Coach and Counsel (2 Cs). She understands the significance of not just
imparting knowledge but also nurturing the holistic development of her
students. Recognising that teachable moments abound, she seizes these opportunities
to instill virtues such as tact, tolerance, and unity.</p>

<p><strong>Teacher-Student Relationship (TSR)</strong>
</p>
<p>Building a strong Teacher-Student Relationship (TSR) is at the core of
Miss Teo's teaching approach. One of her strengths lies in managing student
matters. Rather than dismissing conflicts, she actively engages with her
students, employing open-ended questions to encourage empathy and perspective-taking.
By coaching them effective dispute management strategies, such as asking
what is going on, listening intently to all parties involved, and guiding
them towards solutions, she not only teaches her students conflict resolution
skills but also empowers them to make better choices.</p>

<p><strong>“It takes a village to raise a child”</strong>
</p>
<p>Believing in the proverb "It takes a village to raise a child", Miss Teo
extends counseling and support as a form teacher to all students, particularly
those new to the school. Acknowledging the challenges of transitioning
to a new learning environment, she actively checks in on the emotional,
social, and academic well-being of her students. This includes asking about
their feelings in the new class/ school, whether they have made friends,
and if they need any academic support. She collaborates with all parents,
recognising the importance of a strong partnership between home and school,
and shares coping strategies to ensure the overall well-being of the students.</p>
