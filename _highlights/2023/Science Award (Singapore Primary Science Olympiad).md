This year, our Primary 5 students represented the school in the Singapore Primary Science Olympiad (SPSO) organized by the NUS High School of Mathematics and Science. The annual national competition aims to nurture talents in the Sciences and to cultivate enthusiasm and instill a passion for science subjects among Primary school students.

Our students did the school proud by attaining a Silver Award (Gong Zibo, 5 Sapphire), a Broze Award (Kayden Chu, 5 Sapphire), and three Merit Awards (Vo Catherine Tu, 5 Topaz; Phua Ser Yen, 5 Topaz; Khush Pareek, 5 Sapphire).

 Under the guidance of Mr Samuel Ooi, our students spent months preparing for the competition. Khush shared, “Mr Ooi gave us mini quizzes to check on our understanding frequently. He also provided fun and informative websites for us to extend our learning from home.” Catherine also shared how she had worked together with her sister who took part in the competition last year to better understand the Science topics. Zibo who achieved the Silver Award was grateful to his Science teachers who had taught him how to use the elimination method to select the correct options for every question.

Congratulations to the students on winning the awards! We are proud of you!
