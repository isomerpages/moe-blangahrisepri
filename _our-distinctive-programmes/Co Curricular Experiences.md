<h4>Co-Curricular (CC) Experiences – the 8th Habit way</h4>
<p>As a school that embraces Stephan Covey’s <a href="https://www.blangahrisepri.moe.edu.sg/our-distinctive-programmes/the-leader-in-me/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">7-Habits </a>of
Happy Kids, we adopt a whole-person approach in designing the co-curricular
learning experiences that will develop our students’ 8th Habit - discovering
their personal significance. The students are exposed to a myriad of experiences
filled with opportunities that nurture the 4 intelligences and Emerging
21st Century Competencies and Skills. With the guidance of Teacher Mentors
(TM) who play the roles of a Coach, Counsellor, and Cheerleader, our students
discover their talent, find purpose in what they do and work towards personal
growth to become the future-ready ABCD Learners we envisage – Active, Bold,
Contributing and Disciplined.</p>

<p><strong><u>Mental Intelligence</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Our students’ journey in discovering their passion starts with exposure
to a variety of experiences through our distinctive programmes like <a href="https://www.blangahrisepri.moe.edu.sg/our-distinctive-programmes/applied-learning-programme-alp/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ALP</a>,
<a href="https://www.blangahrisepri.moe.edu.sg/our-distinctive-programmes/learning-for-life-programme/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">LLP</a>, <a href="https://www.blangahrisepri.moe.edu.sg/our-distinctive-programmes/young-photographers/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Young Photographers</a> and
iDiscover. Thus, every student builds his or her knowledge as well as develop
emerging 21st Century competencies and skills in a range of areas - from
STEM education to environment education and performing arts. These varied
learning opportunities ignite our students’ interest, widen their horizons
and lay the foundation for the development of future-ready lifelong learners.</p>
<p><strong><u>Physical Intelligence</u></strong>
</p>
<p>We offer 4 categories of CCA - Sports and Games, Clubs and Societies,
Aesthetics, and Uniformed Groups. Modular CCA (House), P1 and P2 iDiscover
and after-school enrichment programmes introduce sports, games and art
forms beyond the CCA. Talented Blangahnites are given unique opportunities
to further develop their skills with the support of professional coaches
and participate in competitions in one or more sports, games or academic
area. Our students learn to optimize these opportunities to hone skills
in more than one area. For example, we have students from Scouts who are
in our school badminton team and students from Red Cross and STEM club
representing the school in NSG Football!</p>
<p><strong><u>Emotional Intelligences</u></strong>
</p>
<p>To deepen these broad-based experiences in school, we have designed mentoring
programmes where our students interact with knowledgeable others beyond
school and their peers.</p>
<p>Our students from several CCA groups benefit from our partnerships with
secondary schools. For example, we partner ACS (I) for badminton (Boys),
RGS for badminton (Girls), SOTA for MediaKids and Art &amp; Design Club
and SST for STEM Club. These mentoring opportunities inspire and motivate
our students to give their personal best.</p>
<p>Our P3 to P6 students are encouraged and guided by their Teacher Mentors
(TM) to identify and pursue an area that they enjoy through <a href="https://www.blangahrisepri.moe.edu.sg/departments/middle-primary/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Passion Projects</a>.
In addition, with the TM support, our students embark on their DSA journey
as early as Primary 3, giving them a longer runway to explore various areas
of interests and then identify and deepen their competencies and skills
in an area they wish to pursue.</p>
<p><strong><u>Spiritual Intelligence</u></strong>
</p>
<p>As a 7-Habits school that integrates the Virtues Project, our school places
a high premium on values education including the development of social
emotional competencies and e-21st Century competencies like civic literacy,
communication, and collaboration skills. Thus, another unique feature of
our CC Experiences is our CCA Values-In-Action Activities <a href="https://www.blangahrisepri.moe.edu.sg/highlights/2024/telok-blangah/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CCA Values-In-Action Activities </a>aimed
at giving back to the community. CCA groups take turns to conduct monthly
intergenerational bonding activities. In addition, CCA groups also collaborate
with other schools to grow and showcase their talent. This includes our
combined school football team and choir.</p>
<p><strong><u>Partnering our Parents in discovering our Students’ Voices</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Our rich CC Experiences designed with authenticity, affect and agency
complement our students’ learning in the classroom and promote the breadth
and depth of learning. These thoughtfully curated unique CC experiences
and the support of our parents shape our students’ journey in discovering
their passion and purpose and eventually blossoming as future ready ABCD
individuals and citizens.</p>
