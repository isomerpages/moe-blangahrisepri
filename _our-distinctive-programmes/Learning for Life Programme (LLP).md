<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Learning for Life Programme &ndash; Leader for Life</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>-John Quincy Adams-</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Leader for Life</em></strong>&nbsp;aims to develop our students to become joyful and confident learners who are engaged, self-directed and have the rigour and vigour to pursue their own independent learning. Through this specially tailored 6-year programme that focuses on community service and student leadership, students will be equipped with socio-emotional skills and leadership qualities.&nbsp;<strong><em>Leader for Life</em></strong>&nbsp;seeks to enrich students by teaching them to care for themselves, the community and the environment.</p>
<p>Built upon the school&rsquo;s curriculum on Environmental Education,&nbsp;<strong><em>Leader for Life</em></strong>&nbsp;provides opportunities for students to put&nbsp;<em>Stephen Covey&rsquo;s 7 Habits of Happy Kids</em>&nbsp;into action to become Leaders for Life. It adopts a value-based approach to inculcate virtues such as care, respect and responsibility to create a lasting impact on the students&rsquo; own personal and interpersonal growth, as well as encourage them to champion a positive change in the community and environment.</p>
<p>The programme aims to:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">provide students with knowledge and a better understanding of the environment, particularly the impact of humans on the environment</li>
<li aria-level="1">raise students&rsquo; awareness and sensitivity to environmental challenges and</li>
<li aria-level="1">provide authentic platforms for students to explore environmental issues and take</li>
<li aria-level="1">action to improve the environment around them</li>
</ul>
<p>Specially crafted programmes that aim to encapsulate the critical learning objectives of&nbsp;<strong><em>Leader for Life</em></strong>&nbsp;include Little Green Ambassadors, Class VIA @ Blooming Garden, Project GAIA, The Green Snapshots (TGS) Nature and Heritage Trails and Community Outreach Programmes.</p>
<p><strong>Little Green Ambassadors</strong></p>
<p>Little Green Ambassadors form part of the class committee. They are key drivers who look into fostering sustainable environmental habits in the school. Little Green Ambassadors are caring, confident and responsible.</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Caring - thinks green and helps conserve the environment</li>
<li aria-level="1">Confident - enforces class and school green rules; encourages peers to carry out the 4Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Refuse)</li>
<li aria-level="1">Responsible - is a good role model and supports initiatives of Go Green @ BRPS</li>
</ul>
<p>They also assist the teachers to collect data to help the school community reduce waste, conserve water as well as be more energy efficient.</p>

<p><strong>Biodiversity Corridor</strong></br><strong>(comprising the Animals&rsquo; Corner, Blooming Garden and Eco-pond)</strong></p>
<p>The Biodiversity Corridor was created to connect and engage our school community for the conservation of Singapore&rsquo;s natural heritage. It is aligned with the Community in Nature (CIN) initiative and the objectives are to:</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1">Encourage teachers and students to learn, appreciate and support local biodiversity</li>
<li aria-level="1">Encourage student participation in caring for their school grounds and the environment</li>
<li aria-level="1">Promote exchange of information and expertise in enhancing biodiversity in schools</li>
</ol>
<p>A diverse variety of animals and plants can be found along the Biodiversity Corridor. This creates more opportunities for the school community to find out more about the various species and the complex ecosystems that they live in, leading to greater awareness of Singapore&rsquo;s rich biodiversity.</p>
<p><strong>Animals&rsquo; Corner</strong></p>
<p>The Animals&rsquo; Corner is part of the school&rsquo;s effort to equip students with socio-emotional skills and leadership qualities. We inculcate virtues such as care, respect and responsibility to create a lasting impact on the students&rsquo; own personal and interpersonal growth through the school&rsquo;s Learning for Life Programme (LLP). The opportunity to observe, interact, care and learn about animals not only enriches their learning about nature, ecology and relationships, it also inspires them on their learning and discovery journeys as students will be curious to find out more about the animals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We collaborated with the EL Department to give the Primary 2 students the experience of rearing butterflies. In alignment with the EL Stellar unit, &lsquo;A Butterfly is Born&rsquo;, students and teachers had the opportunity to observe the complete metamorphosis of butterflies. The experience also provided students the platform to put the virtues into practice.</p>

<p><strong>Blooming Garden and Eco-pond</strong></p>
<p>With the objectives of providing our students with outdoor experiential learning to complement the teaching and learning of Science as well as to provide our students with an authentic platform for Value-in-Action (VIA) project, classes are each assigned a garden plot to take care of the plants. This provides opportunity for students and teachers to build positive teacher-student relationships as well as imbue in students a sense of responsibility to take care of the environment. Our parents from the Parent Support Group (PSG) also provide valuable knowledge and much of their time in helping to sustain a blooming garden in the school.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Project GAIA</strong></p>
<p>One of our key programmes is Project GAIA (Green Awareness in Action). Project GAIA is a community project to enhance students&rsquo; learning beyond the classroom and promote recycling and environmental conservation in the community. Some of the programmes in Project GAIA include organizing recycling drives as well as activities to commemorate Singapore World Water Day and Earth Day.</p>
<p><strong>Commemorating Singapore World Water Day</strong></p>
<p>World Water Day is commemorated on 22 March every year. The theme for 2022, &ldquo;Groundwater: Making the Invisible, Visible&rdquo; is to heighten our awareness of&nbsp;groundwater, which is a hidden treasure that enriches our lives as most of the liquid freshwater in the world is groundwater. As climate change gets worse, groundwater becomes more critical.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2022,&nbsp;we commemorated Singapore World Water Day through a series of activities. These activities include:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">An Assembly Talk (conducted by Form Teachers in each class)</li>
<li aria-level="1">Exhibits created by PSG are displayed at the school&rsquo;s &lsquo;Community Space&rsquo; to educate students on the importance of using water wisely and cherishing our water resources</li>
<li aria-level="1">Classroom activities such as colouring activities and crossword puzzles promoting water conservation (Resources from PUB and PSG)</li>
<li aria-level="1">Video screenings of water sustainability and water conservation&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level="1">Recess activities - Learning stations in the Mini Library where students had the opportunity to do hands-on activities&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level="1">STEM lesson - Engineering-related Learning Activity on Creating Water Filtration System&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
