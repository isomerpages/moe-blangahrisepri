Our staff is dedicated in deepening their professional practice, in the classroom as well as a teacher mentor. All BRPS teachers are teacher mentors, who coach, cheerlead and counsel our students. Anchored in our educational beliefs, our teachers are committed to innovating in the classroom, and being the guiding light to our students. Hear from five of our staff and their educational philosophies.
