As the Primary 6 students gear up for their upcoming national exams, the school prefects showed their unwavering support and care for their older peers by designing and distributing thoughtful care packs filled with goodies and motivational items. The initiative aims to encourage the graduating cohort during this challenging time and remind them that they are not alone in their journey. 
As one of the prefects in-charge of the initiative, Catherine, of Primary 5, shared that she felt happy that she was part of this project as her sister is a P6 student. Catherine understands the situation well as she sees, firsthand, the workload and pressure her elder sister faces in preparation for the PSLE. Hence, she decided to include snacks like candies to 'sweeten' their journey. Catherine reflected, “We hope that these little treats would bring a smile to their faces amidst the hard work." 
This heartwarming gesture touched the hearts of P6 students. Zesheng from 6T shared, “I was delighted to receive the care pack from the prefects. It motivated me to put in my best efforts for the PSLE.” He added, “This care pack also reminded me of all the good times I've had in this school, where so much care has been shown to me over the years."
Fellow graduand, Richelle, shared, "I am grateful for the care pack as it made me realise that people care for me and want me to do well in PSLE.” For Richelle, her favourite item is the bookmark the prefects had designed. The bookmark comprises self-care tips. “One tip that stood out to me is listening to music for relaxation. I will most definitely do that when I am stressed”.
Through this small act of kindness, we hope that all P6s know that they are well-supported and cared for throughout their journey. From everyone at Blangah Rise Primary School, we wish the P6 students the very best for their PSLE!
