<p>The Art &amp; Design Club participated in this year’s Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Exhibition. For 3 months,&nbsp;Kelly, Rihana, Kayla, Chloe and Mae, aged 10, under the guidance of their teachers, Ms Yanti Binte Rahim and Mrs Esther Loh&nbsp;worked as a team to create an art piece based on the theme Artist and Citizenship.</p>
<p>The artwork “Time to Time” was selected for the on-site exhibition at the National Museum of Singapore from 5 July to 21 July 2019. It was awarded the "Certificate of Recognition" by the SYF panel of judges.&nbsp;Our student representative,&nbsp;Rihana,&nbsp;age 10,&nbsp;had the chance to share about the art piece with guests and visitors to the National Museum of Singapore.</p>
<p>Our student artists&nbsp;will also be involved in the SYF Artist Talk workshop at the National Museum of Singapore.&nbsp;They&nbsp;will take&nbsp;SYF participants through their work processes,&nbsp;starting from ideating, conceptualising and executing the actual work&nbsp;to&nbsp;bring their work to fruition.&nbsp;The student artists will be facilitating the art-making process with young participants from other school and create another piece of mixed media artwork at the venue itself.</p>
<p>Well done&nbsp;to our very own Blangah Rise&nbsp;student artists!</p>
