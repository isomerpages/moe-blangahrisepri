<p>Did you know that many centuries ago, people celebrated Mid-Autumn Festival by attaching riddles to lanterns, also known as &ldquo;Deng Mi&rdquo; (灯谜)? Prior to our Mid-Autumn Festival celebration, we had our very own BRPS &ldquo;Lantern Riddles&rdquo; activity in the canteen, which was done up by our Parents&rsquo; Support Group. Students had a great time finding solutions to these riddles!</p>
<p>This year, we celebrated Mid-Autumn Festival 2021 on 21 September, which was also the actual day of Mid-Autumn Festival. During the e-Celebration, our emcees Melody Tan (5 Sapphire) and Yizhien Chong (5 Topaz), shared the legend of Mid-Autumn Festival with the school. Some of our students also presented confidently to the rest of their friends on how they celebrated Mid-Autumn Festival back in their countries such as Vietnam and Korea.</p>
<p>Besides learning about the legend and different cultures, our students were also engaged in the making of lanterns using recycled bottles. Through this activity, they learnt the importance of recycling and the principle behind electrical circuits.</p>
<p>The celebration ended with a showcase of our talented Blangahnites doing their very own rendition of《城里的月光》.These performers were the winners of the first ever BRPS Chinese talent contest &ldquo;BRPS Chinese Idol&rdquo;. It was a fun-filled and meaningful celebration for all of us!</p>
