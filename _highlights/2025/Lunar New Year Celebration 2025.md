<p>We celebrated the Lunar New Year on 28 January 2025 with great joy and
enthusiasm! Our emcees, Aarya from 5 Opal, Basyirah from 5 Topaz, and Carys
from 5 Sapphire, led the celebration, bringing excitement and festive cheer
to everyone.</p>
<p>We were delighted to welcome parents from the Parent Support Group (PSG)
and elderly guests from the Lions Befriender Club for this special occasion.
Have you seen the beautiful artwork created by our talented PSG members?
They designed a “福” in the form of a snake, symbolising blessings for a
wonderful year ahead!</p>

<p>To kick off the celebration, students and teachers spring-cleaned their
classrooms and put up decorations, bringing the festive spirit to life.
This meaningful activity engaged everyone to start the new year in a clean
and welcoming environment!</p>
<p>The celebration officially began with a video featuring our School Leaders,
parents, and teachers sharing their warm wishes for the Lunar New Year.
This was followed by a sing-along session led by our Primary 2 students,
who introduced various traditions associated with the festival. It was
heartwarming to see students of different races coming together to exchange
good wishes for the new year!</p>

<p>One of the highlights was the lion dance performance! Did you know that
the lion symbolises strength, courage, and good fortune? The energetic
performance filled the hall with joy and excitement, setting the festive
mood for everyone. Hinata from 6 Sapphire especially enjoyed the lively
lion dance, which was the highlight of the celebration.</p>

<p>Next, our Primary 4 students shared about traditional Lunar New Year goodies
and their meanings. For example, love letters symbolise love and happiness,
while Nian Gao represents good progress and improvement.</p>

<p>We were also treated to a special Latin dance performance by Audrey from
6 Sapphire and Henry from 5 Sapphire, who danced to a lively Lunar New
Year tune. Their elegant and rhythmic moves captivated the audience! Marvell
from 6 Sapphire felt that the dance was a unique and well-choreographed
addition to the festive cheers.</p>

<p>As part of our school’s annual tradition, Mr Leow led the entire school
in a Lunar New Year workout. It was a fun and energetic way to start the
year on a positive note!</p>

<p>To conclude the celebration, we presented oranges to our elderly guests,
parents, and school staff as a token of appreciation and well wishes. Aarya
from 5 Opal felt very honoured and happy to have the opportunity to host
this year’s celebration.</p>
<p>We wish everyone a Happy Lunar New Year! May the year ahead bring happiness,
good health, and prosperity to all!</p>
