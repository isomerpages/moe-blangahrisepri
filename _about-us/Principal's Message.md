Learning is an adventure that can be both a struggle and a joy. Oftentimes, the 2 are inseparable. Some struggle to find the joy of learning, whilst others discover joy in the struggle of learning. How do we transform the struggle to joy? To get some insight into this, it will be useful to try and understand what some of the “struggles” of learning can be.

The first struggle is the struggle of ownership. “Easy learning” is to expect that the knowledge will be handed to us on a platter, and little effort is required of us. “Why don’t you just tell me the answer?” But to own our learning is to be self-directed and take responsibility for making meaning of what we are learning. This may require us to read further on our own, actively ask questions to clear our doubts, or just to practice the task to get more clarity. Nobody knows what we don’t know better than ourselves. The response to this struggle is to be an **Active Learner**.

The second struggle is the struggle of failure. We may fear about learning something new or difficult and worry if we will be able to overcome the challenges, especially if we have been failing in our initial attempts. But if we understand that challenges and failures are just part of the natural process of learning, we focus on our effort and dedication instead. We embrace a growth mindset and believe that if we work hard and persevere, we may learn more and learn it more quickly. Challenges and failures are just opportunities to build our learning muscle! Exercise courage and be a **Bold Learner**.

The third struggle is the struggle of adaptability. Like it or not, we are going to have to learn how to learn with others. We will encounter learners different from us, and this will require us to also consider their learning needs besides our own. Without being adaptable to our learning environment, we limit our own and others’ learning. But other learners will bring their own ideas and enrich our learning, provided we have an open mind. It is the active contribution from each one that will help us to learn faster, wider and deeper. Team learning can be a learning multiplier. So, be a **Contributing Learner**.

The fourth struggle is the struggle of distraction. With a zillion things to draw our attention away, it can be difficult to stay focus on what needs to be learnt. Our natural curiosity is the cause of this distraction. But this same natural curiosity can be one of our most powerful learning tools, if we harness it in the right direction. Curiosity pushes us out of our comfort zone and is the impetus for discovery learning and creative thinking. How we channel this tremendous force for our good is through the exercise of discipline. We practice routines of behaviour that allow us to control ourselves and focus on what is important, such as being proactive, beginning with the end in mind and putting first things first. We accomplish more by being a **Disciplined Learner**.

Let’s help make our children’s and our own adventure in learning this year a joyful one by becoming an ABCD Learner – active, bold, contributing and disciplined.
