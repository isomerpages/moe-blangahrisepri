<p><strong>LEVEL PROGRAMMES IN 2024</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>P4 Discovery Camp 2024<br></strong>A fun-filled after school programme
which helps our students to enjoy their schooling experience, develop skills
and forge strong bonds / relationships with their school mates.</p>
<p>Welcome to our Discovery Camp, where students acquire essential life skills
beyond the classroom. Our 'Managing Distractions' activity focuses on navigating
distractions at school or home. Students explore personal triggers and
practical coping strategies. The highlight of our camp is the collaborative
poster-making session, where students join forces to visually represent
effective distraction management techniques. This hands-on activity not
only fosters creativity and teamwork but also reinforces their understanding
of the strategies discussed.</p>

<p><strong>P4 Learning Journey to Geylang Serai Heritage Gallery</strong>
</p>
<p>This learning journey has provided our P4 students a transformative experience
by immersing them in the vibrant cultural community of Geylang Serai. Through
hands-on exploration and guided fieldwork, our students have gained a deeper
understanding of Malay-Muslim culture and heritage, fostering empathy and
respect for the community's contributions to multicultural Singapore. Engaging
in activities such as sketching architecture, tasting traditional cuisine
and hearing personal stories from community members have enhanced students'
cultural awareness and empathy. By connecting classroom learning with real-world
experiences, this learning journey cultivates critical thinking, empathy,
and appreciation for diversity, empowering our students to become informed
and respectful global citizens.</p>
