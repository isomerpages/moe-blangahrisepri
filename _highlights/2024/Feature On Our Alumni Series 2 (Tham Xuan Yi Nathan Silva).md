<p>Nathan graduated from Blangah Rise Primary School (BRPS) in 2023. During
his time with BRPS, Nathan served as the Deputy Head Prefect and Football
CCA Leader.</p>
<p>Last year, Nathan applied to his choice secondary school via Direct School
Admission (DSA). He was not only accepted but also offered a sports scholarship.
In this feature, Nathan would like to thank his BRPS teachers for guiding,
supporting and nurturing him in his primary school education, which in
turn helped him to cope well in secondary school. Nathan would also like
to encourage all our Primary 6 students who are applying to their choice
secondary school via DSA all the best. Go, Blangahnites!</p>
