<p>2022 is a year of jubilation when CCAs and competitions are finally being able to resume.&nbsp;&nbsp;NSG began in March 2022 and Blangah Rise Primary School was able to rise to this special&nbsp;occasion by sending our Senior Girls team, comprising five P5 Girls and 6 P6 Girls, to represent the school.&nbsp;It is definitely a moment to be remembered for BRPS Badminton as our Badminton Senior Division Girls team fought steadfastly in these games considering that the team was only established in the year 2020.</p>

<p>The girls competed valiantly in every match and managed to win some of them. Our girls were proud&nbsp;and honored to have represented the school.&nbsp; It was an enriching experience for all of them as it was their first time in competing in the event.&nbsp;We look forward to more exciting and successful stories as we&nbsp;prepare for the NSG Junior Division.</p>
<p>As members of&nbsp;the BRPS Badminton team, students proactively honed their skills and learned to become better sportsmen and sportswomen. We are an inclusive team, ranginf from a new member with an interest in badminton, not having even the basis skill of holding the racket right, to a competent player with the ability to smash a shuttlecock across the court.&nbsp; Indeed, our members in the team have learnt and grown. The training has allowed them to grow to better skilled badminton players and to develop the virtues such as determination and perseverance.</p>

<p>Indeed, our Badminton CCA takes seriously our mission to mould character and promote the game of badminton. In doing so, we engage qualified and professional certified coaches for every single sessions of the training.&nbsp; Apart from the usual CCA practice, we also engage our members in the holiday training programme during the March and June holidays. Our main focus during these trainings include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Skills and techniques related to the sport</li>
<li>To participate in different levels of competition to gain experience and exposure</li>
<li>To play the sport at various levels progressively to nurture their talent and develop their interest and passion for it</li>
</ul>

<p>Under the school&rsquo;s CCA Stewardship Program, members with distinct leadership potential are also given opportunities to develop their leadership skills. Members under the program are equipped with the confidence and interpersonal skills needed to lead their peers in the path of becoming better players on the court. They take on the roles as coaches; teaching their peer such as how to do a proper overhead forehand stroke. They may also be cheerleaders, who will motivate their peers during trainings and competitions.&nbsp; Evidently, an increase of members applying for DSA (Badminton) has demonstrated an ever-strong demand for the CCA.</p>
