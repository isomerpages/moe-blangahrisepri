<p>We commemorated EAS Day 2024, an event dedicated to honouring the unsung
heroes of the school – the non-teaching staff. Into its fifth year, the
annual commemoration was organised under the theme A.C.E., which stands
for Appreciation, Cohesion, and Engagement, emphasising the school’s deep
commitment to recognising the invaluable contributions of its non-teaching
staff which comprises administration and operations staff, security officers,
ICT personnel, teaching support staff, and school cleaners.</p>
<p>The commemoration started with a school assembly where the essential role
of the EAS staff was highlighted via a purposeful video tribute, and an
exciting games segment that fostered a strong sense of unity between students
and the non-teaching staff.</p>
<p>In the week leading up to EAS Day, students were actively involved in
expressing their gratitude by crafting personalised thank-you cards and
notes of appreciation. These heartfelt messages were displayed prominently
in the school canteen, serving as a symbol of students' appreciation. A
care pack containing snacks and a thank-you card were also distributed
to each EAS officer, symbolising the school’s gratitude for their unwavering
support.</p>

<p>The commemoration concluded with a wellness activity, where student leaders
facilitated a therapeutic Art session, offering the EAS staff a moment
to unwind and engage in creative expression.</p>
<p>Natalie from Primary 5 Topaz reflected on the significance of EAS Day,
emphasising the hard work and dedication of the non-teaching staff who
contribute immensely to creating a positive school environment. She shared
her pride in being part of the wellness activity, viewing it as a meaningful
opportunity to connect with the EAS staff.</p>

<p>Kai Ting from Primary 4 Sapphire echoed this sentiment, expressing that
even small gestures, such as writing a simple thank-you card, can bring
immense joy. She felt grateful for the chance to convey her appreciation
to the staff through the cards she lovingly crafted.</p>
<p>EAS Day 2024 was a reminder of the important roles that all members of
the school community play in making Blangah Rise Primary School a nurturing
and welcoming environment for everyone.</p>
