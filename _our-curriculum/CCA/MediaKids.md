MediaKids is an extension of our [Young Photographers](https://blangahrisepri.moe.edu.sg/our-distinctive-programmes/young-photographers/) programme, where our students acquire advanced photography skills and work on school publications.
<p>As an opportunity to hone their photography skills, our MediaKids take on the role of official photographer for school events and participate in national competitions. Through these platforms, our MediaKids develop their creativity, interpersonal skills and collaboration skills.</p>
<p><strong>Telling Their Own Stories</strong></p>

<p>These are some of the composition techniques which our MediaKids have learnt in photography. During their weekly CCA, they have the opportunity to handle a DSLR, as well as learn about its functions and how each of the functions is vital to capturing a good photograph. They extend their skills in school&nbsp;through creative photography with props.

Carys, a Primary 3 student says, “We get to take photographs using the DSLR, and learn about the different functions and buttons!”

Our MediaKids’ works are reviewed by their trainer, who gives them constructive feedback on their photographs. This provides our MediaKids an insight on what they did well and how they can improve in their photographs.

“I learn that sharing and reviewing each other’s work help us to become better in our skills and techniques,” says Rishi, a Primary 3 student.</p>

</p><p>MediaKids also have the opportunity to hone their photography skills through outdoor shoots at locations such as Telok Blangah Hill Park, Mount Faber, HortPark, Labrador Nature Reserve and Keppel Bay Bridge. 
They apply composition techniques as such Rule of Thirds, Leading Lines and Framing. Their works are proudly displayed at our photo gallery in school and used in our publications! At the same time, MediaKids get to learn more about the environment and explore environmental issues through their lenses.
“The outdoor shoots are a lot of fun. We get to compare composition techniques and share ideas. We learn how each of us have different stories in our photographs. Different people look at the same object differently,” says Ka Shing, a Primary 4 student.

<p>To commemorate the Singapore Bicentennial, MediaKids worked on a Bicentennial-themed coffee table book, “Singapore Through Children’s Eyes” which was presented to President Halimah Yacob on 28 July 2019. President Halimah had written a foreword for the book, which was supported by the Singapore Bicentennial Office.

<img style="width: 65%;" src="/images/Covid-19-274x300.jpg">
<p>MediaKids’ photographs taken during their e-CCA sessions were featured in our book, “Here Comes The Storm Now: Our Covid-19 Diary”. It documents our Covid-19 experiences through the eyes of our educators, children and parents. This book is dedicated to frontline heroes who have kept Singapore safe so that our children can continue learning in school.

<p><strong>Special Event with Local Sportsmen and Sportswomen</strong></p>
<img src="/images/Photo-7-1.jpg">
<p>In line with the upcoming Tokyo Olympics, our students embarked on a project to gather inspirational stories and messages from our local sportsmen and sportswomen. In September 2019, we invited Singapore’s very own football legend, Mr Fandi Ahmad to our school. Our MediaKids took photographs of him being interviewed by our student leaders and conducting a football clinic for our boys in the Football CCA group.</p>

<p>There were other platforms which gave our MediaKids opportunities to hone their photography skills. In 2020, we met our nation’s World Number 1 Para Archer, Ms Nur Syahidah Alim. Aqeel, our Primary 4 MediaKid, not only captured the session through his lenses, but was also inspired to overcome challenges and pursue his dreams and goals.</p>

In celebration of Biodiversity Week from 19 to 26 May 2023, we produced a coffee table book titled “A Bowl of Nature”. Our MediaKids applied their photography skills and captured biodiversity through their lenses.

<p><strong>Other Platforms to extend our MediaKids’ Learning: Photography Exhibition</strong></p>

Titled Virtues of Creativity and Flexibility, this photograph was taken at Labrador Nature Reserve by Ser Yen. It was selected to be exhibited at the 18th Ngee Ann Photographic Exhibition for the Student Category. 
Accompanying her photograph was a write-up:
I like to experiment and try new things. This is my first time capturing the landscape by using a lensball. The landscape of Labrador Nature Reserve appears as an inverted image in the lensball. This image resonates with me as it reminds me of being creative, flexible and looking at things from different perspectives, especially when we are facing difficulties.
Ser Yen said, “Our CCA lessons are conducted by a professional photographer. Through him, we learn more than just taking photographs. Our outdoor shoots include understanding the environment and nature, and how our cameras can capture how nature interact.”

Mdm Uuchi, teacher in charge of MediaKids, shared “Through photography, our students develop observation skills, artistic expression and a deeper appreciation for the world around them. Our outdoor shoots are also very hands-on, providing opportunities for our students to practise their photography skills in real-world settings.”
