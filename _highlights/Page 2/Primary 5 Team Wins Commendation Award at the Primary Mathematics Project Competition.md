<p>This year, Gail Lien (5 Sapphire), Nathanael Chin (5 Sapphire) and Athan Phua (5 Topaz) represented our school in the Primary Mathematics Project Competition (PMPC), which was jointly organised by the MOE Gifted Education Branch and NUS High School. At the competition, the students had to creatively design a Math-related game and apply mathematics to solve real-life problems.</p>
<p>The team worked hard and won the Commendation Award for the Primary 5 category. They designed a board game titled &ldquo;Arrowing Maths&rdquo; which was inspired by the game &ldquo;Snakes and Ladders&rdquo; but with a Math twist. The game required players to solve fun Math questions at each turn.</p>
<p>Through the game design process, the team honed their collaborative skills, independent learnings skills as well as resilience. Gail shared, &ldquo;I enjoyed the experience of working in a team! We were able to build upon each other&rsquo;s ideas and supported each other whenever our game design hit a roadblock.&rdquo; For instance, Athan shared that the team had to re-draw the board when their board was not drawn to scale. Finding a common time to meet amidst their busy schedule was also a challenge. Despite these difficulties, Nathanael shared that the team constantly told themselves that they could do it and eventually persevered to complete the game.</p>
<p>Well done, team!</p>
