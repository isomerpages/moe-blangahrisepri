<p><strong>Junior Primary &ndash; Drama &amp; Choir</strong></p>
<p>Lights! Action! Through Drama, our Primary 1 students learn language skills and build their social and emotional competencies in a fun and engaging way. What better way than stepping into the shoes of a character to learn virtues such as empathy and consideration? Through that, they will begin to understand themselves and others better. With their Form Teachers&rsquo; coaching, students grow in confidence in oral language skills and speaking in front of others.</p>
<p>For our Primary 2 classes, a choir was formed. During Programme for Active Learning (PAL) and Music lessons, the students worked together for various choral performances. When Covid-19 hit the nation, opportunities opened for the teachers to guide the students in displaying the virtue of thankfulness. The students used their voices to appreciate and encourage the Covid-19 frontline heroes.
