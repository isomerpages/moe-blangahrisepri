<br>During the camp, our students participated in team building activities,
high elements and nature walk. They lived out the school's RISE values
as they encouraged, helped and inspired one another towards greater heights.</p>

<p><em>"My most significant camp moment was the rock climbing as I did not expect myself to go so high up. I thought I could not do it as my hands were aching but I persevered. I am really happy that I did it! I learnt perseverance during the camp and I can put it into practice if I feel like giving up on my homework."</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;

<p><em>"The most significant moment was when we did the high elements. The reason why I find high elements so interesting is because I have never done high elements before. On one of the obstacles, I fell but was held by the safety harness. I climbed back up and continued the obstacle."&nbsp;</em>–

<p><em>"My most significant moment during the camp was when we went to the Wallance Trail. The trail was very muddy. The terrain uneven but we helped each other. We even sang a song on our way back. I appreciate everybody in my group. I practised the school's RISE values during camp and I can practise these RISE values daily too. For example, I can practise respect by listening to my family, teachers and friends. I can practise integrity by doing the right things even when no one is looking."</em>&nbsp;–
