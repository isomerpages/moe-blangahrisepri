<p><strong>TGS Returns with &ldquo;The Green Snapshots with Pepper Green and Friends&rdquo;!</strong></p>
<p>After a two-year hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our award-winning heritage trail, The Green Snapshots (TGS) physical trail, has once again returned in July 2022! We once again invited members of the public to join us on our curated nature and heritage trail around our neighborhood. This year&rsquo;s edition was indeed special as it was adapted from the school&rsquo;s recent self-written publication, "The Green Dragonflies and Their Swampy Friends".</p>
<p>Titled "The Green Snapshots with Pepper Green and Friends", participants went on a learning journey around Telok Blangah Hill Park and Berlayer Creek at Labrador Park. Berlayer Creek, a mangrove swamp, was the setting of our book featuring Pepper Green, a young dragonflies, and his friends. The inclusion of Berlayer Creek in this year&rsquo;s edition of TGS reinforces a key message: Everyone, young and old, can play a part in conserving the environment and making it a cleaner and greener place amidst climate change.</p>
<p>Led by our student-docents, participants learnt about plants and animals at the various &lsquo;hotspots&rsquo; in the area. The information sharing was also complemented with hands-on activities and food tasting for en even more engaging experience. A participant commented, &ldquo;I had a wonderful session. The students were confident, both in sharing the prepared materials and in engaging directly in conversations. The hands-on materials were a welcome surprise. Without this, the trail would already have been very enjoyable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the TGS trail ended its run on 23 July 2022, it is definitely not the end to nature education in our school. We look forward to bringing more TGS trails to our community in the future!</p>
