Our Modern Dance CCA equips students in fundamental dance skills such as balance, coordination, flexibility, and musicality. We also develop students in character excellence through the practice of virtues such as confidence, discipline, and teamwork.

Besides participating in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation for Dance, we also perform in external and internal events (e.g. School Open House, Chinese New Year Celebration and BRLC Celebrates!) to serve the school and wider community. In 2023, we participated in the National Active Ageing and Intergenerational Bonding initiative – Active X by SportsSG. Through this participation, our young students get to connect with and relate to Senior Citizens better.

Modern Dance CCA provides a pathway for our students to pursue their interest and life-long learning. A few of P6 dancers plan to apply to their choice secondary schools via Direct School Admission (DSA) in the talent area of dance. Lea Store (6 Sapphire) reflected, “I love dancing as I’m able to express myself through movement. I can pursue my dreams through dancing. Dance has helped me to learn determination as I cannot give up when everyone has been working hard for the dance. It is my aspiration to further my training in dance in my secondary school.”

To prepare the SYF Arts Presentation of Dance 2024, our dancers have been putting extra hours to practice and rehearse for their performance. Qistina (4 Topaz) shared,” This is my first time participating in SYF. I feel excited and I practice hard. I attend every CCA session, and I also practice at home. I believe we can do well in the SYF Presentation.”
