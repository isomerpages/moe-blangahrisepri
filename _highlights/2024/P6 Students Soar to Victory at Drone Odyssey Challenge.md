<p>Congratulations to our Primary 6 students, Ser Yen, Suxiang, and Ruo-shan,
for their outstanding achievement at the inaugural Drone Odyssey Challenge
(DOC) 2024, organised by the Science Centre Singapore and its partners.
Our team's exceptional performance earned them first place in the Best
Presentation Award category, a testament to their dedication and innovative
thinking.</p>
<p><strong>About the Drone Odyssey Challenge</strong>
</p>
<p>The Drone Odyssey Challenge is a thrilling game-based competition designed
to foster technical skills, critical thinking, and an appreciation for
cutting-edge technologies. Open to both primary and secondary school students,
the challenge encourages teamwork and problem-solving as participants code
programmable drones to execute tasks in various scenarios.</p>
<p>This year's theme, "Drones for Good," emphasised the potential of drones
to address real-world challenges and create a positive impact. The competition
provided students with valuable insights into how drones can be harnessed
for the betterment of society.</p>

<p>Held at the Science Centre on July 16th, the competition consisted of
two main segments: a presentation and a drone programming and flying challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Presentation</strong>
</p>
<p>Students were required to deliver a 5-minute presentation followed by
a 5-minute Q&amp;A session with the judges. The presentation aimed to showcase
the team's research, problem-solving abilities, and understanding of drone
applications. Our team's presentation focused on the challenges of traditional
land surveying methods and proposed using drones as a safer, more efficient,
and cost-effective solution.</p>
<p><strong>Drone Programming and Flying</strong>
</p>
<p>In this segment, students were tasked with completing a series of challenges
using their coded drones. The specific tasks were revealed only at the
competition venue to ensure that students demonstrated their independent
coding skills. The challenges involved navigating obstacle courses, performing
precise maneuvers, and potentially incorporating elements of drone swarming
or AI-powered visual sensing, depending on the category.</p>

<p>Ser Yen, Suxiang and Ruo-shan's winning presentation highlighted the problems
associated with traditional land surveying, such as the high cost, inherent
dangers and potential inaccuracies of manual data collection. They proposed
using drones equipped with high-resolution cameras to create accurate 3D
models and cadastral maps, significantly improving the speed and safety
of land surveys. Their innovative solution impressed the judges and secured
them the first-place award.</p>
<p>We are incredibly proud of our students' accomplishments at the Drone
Odyssey Challenge. Their success reflects their passion for learning, technological
aptitude and commitment to using their skills for the greater good. Congratulations
to Ser Yen, Suxiang, and Ruo-shan on this well-deserved recognition!</p>
