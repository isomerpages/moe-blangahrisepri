Our Young Photographers programme provided an exciting opportunity for students to explore the world of photography while discovering the beauty of their surroundings. Equipped with DSLR cameras and guided by professional instructors, the students embarked on a journey filled with learning and adventure.

For our Primary 5 students, Marina Barrage became their canvas. Against the backdrop of Singapore's skyline, they learnt not only to frame captivating shots but also to appreciate the importance of sustainable development. The outdoor shoot sparked their curiosity and encouraged them to see their environment through a new lens.

“It was a wonderful experience as it was my first time at Marina Barrage. I was glad I had the opportunity to apply composition techniques gleaned and experienced this with my friends,” Vivian shared excitedly. 
Dave agreed, relaying that, “Young Photographers was fun and memorable as we got to learn new composition techniques which we could apply in our lives. We could also use our photographs to tell a story about our environment and Marina Barrage.”

Through Young Photographers, our Primary 5 students had learnt more than composition techniques. Their eyes were opened to the wonders of nature and they were imbued with a sense of creativity and environmental stewardship. 

Our students will be leveraging their photographs to create and communicate stories through their lenses through Viewpoints – a photojournalism activity to enhance language skills and deliver an authentic learning experience. Students will be using Google Classroom for this photojournalism activity! We look forward to reading their stories!
