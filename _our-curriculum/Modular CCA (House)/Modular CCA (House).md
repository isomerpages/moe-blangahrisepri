<p>House Practice has always been a part of Blangah Rise Primary School since
its founding more than 45 years ago. In 2021, we re-established House Practice
to strengthen the school spirit and to build empowering teacher-student
relationships.</p>
<p>Our Houses are named after Singapore’s heritage. Each House carries a
part of Singapore’s history and embodies virtues that guide our students
to grow as independent as well as inter-dependent learners.</p>
<p>Through House Practice,</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>teachers and students are connected as we cheerlead one another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers intentionally coach students to grow as ABCD learners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers intentionally impart virtues to students (e.g. during teachable
moments).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>House Practice takes place from Term 1 to Term 3 and is offered to all
P3 to P6 students. During House Practice, students participate in modular
sports CCA and learn new skills in Athletics and Floorball. In Term 1 and
Term 2, Inter-House Games are organized to promote character and sports
excellence in our students. In Term 4, the annual Walk-A-Jog is organized
in conjunction to raise fund for Singapore Children’s Society (SC).</p>
