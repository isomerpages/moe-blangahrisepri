<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Photographer of the Year 2021</strong></h2>
<p>We organised our first photography competition this year &ndash; Photographer of the Year. The theme for this competition is &ldquo;Home&rdquo;. This is a platform for our students to define what &ldquo;Home&rdquo; mean to them, and to extend their photography skills gleaned from our distinctive programme, Young Photographers.</p>
<p>Through the competition, we aim to engage our students in self-directed learning through brainstorming of ideas, extending photography composition techniques knowledge through Student Learning Space (SLS). Students can also synergise their creative skills, photography skills, and writing skills to interpret the theme &ldquo;Home&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Check out our students&rsquo; Best Photo Story and Honourable Mention pieces.</p>

<p>My photograph, which shows how a spider has formed a web in my neighbourhood, showcases the given theme of "home". It can be interpreted in a negative way that our homes are often neglected because everyone is so busy with school and work and not spending enough time to notice many things. It can also be viewed in a positive way where the environment we live in is peaceful enough for a living creature to make their own homes among us. With the current pandemic situation, we stay home much more and spend more time with our families and notice more nature and everything around us. We can use this time to appreciate our home and respect the homes of others by being responsible and good human beings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Buildings, Plants, The sunshine. It reminds me of my beautiful home. Different colours and different shades of the sunshine represents the shelter that is covering us. Different houses with their own unique decorations and plants remind me of how diverse our culture can be. It reminds me that if we work together as one, we will fight the pandemic and gain freedom. It also reminds me that if we tell ourselves that the day is awesome, the day will be just as awesome as the different shades and colours and culture. I love my home!</p>

<p>Lights up&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the night falls, everyone goes back to their warm home and reunite with their loved ones. You can see their lights go up and different coloured lights fill up the building with joy. It makes me think of the different races contributing together to make our nation stronger and brighter. I used the Rule of Thirds technique in taking this photo.</p>

<p>A home is a place where we used to play and relax. But after Covid-19, a home is where you work, play, and relax all at the same time. People now can bond better at home, with work a few steps away.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">The blue sky and the greenery from the trees represents Singapore as people call Singapore a Garden City.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This is our home where we stay, live, work, study and play.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was inspired by F-15SG. I built this out of Lego pieces. It took me one hour to build this. F-15SG is used by the Singapore Air Force to protect our homes and nation from any air threats. It keeps our homes safe. In the future, I hope to see the F-15SG in real life.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>2 Sapphire</strong></p>
<p>I used the composition technique of leading lines to present my photograph with the theme "My home". Everyone needs a home. We need a home, even animals need a home. Home is a safe and comfortable place where we live in, where we can play and sleep well. Just like the picture, Kazuki (the dog) shows you how comfortable his home is and where he feels safe.</p>

<p>I took this photograph lying down on the playground. I used the Leading Lines technique for my photograph. My photograph is of the HDB flats in my neighbourhood. It showcases the theme Home because this is where my neighbours and I live and play together.</p>
