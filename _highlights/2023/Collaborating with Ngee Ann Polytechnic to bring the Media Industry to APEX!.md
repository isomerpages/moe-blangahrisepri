We are proud to announce our dynamic partnership with Ngee Ann Polytechnic, a collaboration centered on mutual growth. This partnership allowed our students to embark on an educational journey that has not only enriched our students but also allowed NP students to give back to the community.
Across four engaging sessions, student coaches from Ngee Ann Polytechnic covered a spectrum of skills, from content ideation to video editing using Capcut, crafting compelling interview questions to the art of photography and framing. They brought to our classroom a wealth of experience and knowledge, elevating our BRPS students' understanding of journalism and multimedia creation. The professionalism and dedication of the NP student coaches left a lasting impact, inspiring our students and giving them a glimpse into the media industry.
