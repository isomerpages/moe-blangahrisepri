Our school commemorated World Water Day on March 19, initiating efforts to promote water sustainability. Aligned with the global theme "Water for Peace" and Singapore's focus on "Simple Actions. Sustainable Future‚Äù. The event highlighted the vital role of water in global stability and prosperity. It also aimed to instill a sense of responsibility within the community regarding water conservation.
During an assembly talk, Student Leaders took the lead in sharing information about the global water insecurity scenario and Singapore's Water Story. Staff and students gained insights into current and future water demands, as well as the cost of water in Singapore. Emphasising the significance of simple actions for sustainability, Student Leaders introduced practical ways to promote water conservation and cleanliness.
"Through World Water Day activities, I have learnt that small actions matter in ensuring water sustainability," said Kai Xiang, Primary 5. 
Interactive classroom sessions, categorised by grade levels, enabled students to delve deeper into water conservation virtues and practices. From discussing the importance of self-discipline in saving water to fostering a sense of responsibility in keeping water clean, each activity aimed at reminding our students of their roles in water conservation.

Recess activities encouraged collective participation, with our Parent Support Group (PSG) leading our staff and students in pledging to save water and the students watching engaging videos relating to our 4 National Taps and water conservation in the canteen.
Jolene from Primary 3 shared, "Through World Water Day activities, I have learnt that our small actions matter. It is important that each of us play a role in saving water." 
There were post-activities offering quizzes and reflective exercises to deepen students' comprehension of water conservation. A group of our students also participated in a World Water Day infographic-design competition organised by Dunman High School. Additionally, specialised science lessons, including making a Water Filtering System and exploring rain harvesting techniques in our Garden of Hope, expanded students' horizons, ensuring a comprehensive approach to water sustainability education.
