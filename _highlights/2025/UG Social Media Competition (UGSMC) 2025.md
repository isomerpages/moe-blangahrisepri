<p>Our students have done us proud at the UG Social Media Competition (UGSMC)
2025!</p>
<p>
<br>Aligned with this year’s theme, #NotYour_UG_Stereotype, the competition
invited UG students, alumni, teachers, and volunteers to creatively showcase
their lived experiences through short videos. These stories highlight how
Uniformed Groups nurture character, leadership, and citizenship beyond
common stereotypes.</p>
<p>Our school team, comprising Red Cross and Scouts members, was part of
a winning entry this year. We are proud to celebrate the achievements of
Marvell and Temperance (Red Cross), Thaddeus and Leticia (Scouts), who
represented our school with excellence and received the award.</p>
