<p>Our school commemorated Total Defence Week from 12th to 15th February 2019.&nbsp; This year&rsquo;s theme is &lsquo;Together We Keep Singapore Strong&rsquo;. We kick-started the commemoration of Total Defence Day (TDD) with an assembly programme on 12th February which featured a presentation entitled, 'The Singapore Story', by Art Outreach. The presentation highlighted one of the pioneers of Singapore&mdash;the Samsui Women.</p>

This was followed by an assembly talk on the&nbsp;6 pillars of Total Defence&mdash; Military Defence, Civil Defence, Economic Defence, Social Defence, &nbsp;Psychological Defence and Digital Defence. To round off the commemoration, pupils were given bowls of sweet potato porridge for their snack break, sponsored by SATS.</p>
