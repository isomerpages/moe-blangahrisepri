<p><em>“The five S’s of sports training are: Stamina, Speed, Strength, Skill, and Spirit; but the greatest of these is Spirit.” </em>–
Ken Doherty</p>
<p>As we approach Children’s Day, we would like to celebrate our students
for their participation and achievements in sports in 2024. This year,
our students achieved many new milestones in sports and inspired us with
their spirit of excellence.</p>
<p>Natalie represented our school in the National Primary Schools Sport Climbing
Championship (NPSSC). She qualified and had to compete in two finals events
on the same day. In the Bouldering Finals, Natalie missed the medal by
a placing. While she was disappointed, she had to put the setback behind
and prepare for the Top Rope Finals.</p>
<p>In the Top Rope Finals, Natalie climbed with precision and grit, and scored
the 2nd highest total points. Getting there was not easy as she had to
dig deep. Natalie chose to believe in herself even after the narrow miss
in the Bouldering Finals. She was elated and shared, “I’m so happy I won
2nd place, I didn’t expect this specially when I did not do so good in
the preliminary rounds. Now I realized that anything can happen in the
finals when you do not give up but persevere!”</p>

<p>Playing doubles in Badminton, Ayden and Aarya worked very well together.
While they were disappointed by a narrow loss in their final match, they
both look forward to training and growing stronger together. They are motivated
to compete, progress and excel in the next NSG.</p>

<p>Minh Anh shares her NSG Basketball experience, “this is my second year
representing BRPS. Each time I compete in NSG, I want to play better and
contribute to the team. After every match, I learn about my good points
and also areas for improvement. I constantly work hard to improve.”</p>
