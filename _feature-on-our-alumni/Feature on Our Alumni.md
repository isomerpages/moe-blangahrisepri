<p>In this special feature, we like to celebrate one of our alumni. Choo
Yi Xuan graduated from Blangah Rise Primary School in 2017 and studied
in NUS High School from 2018 to 2023. During her time in NUS High School,
Yi Xuan made significant contributions to the school and received 2023
Outstanding Student Award in CCA, Leadership and Service. As we listen
to Yi Xuanâ€™s story, let us be inspired to grow, learn and serve. &nbsp;</p>
