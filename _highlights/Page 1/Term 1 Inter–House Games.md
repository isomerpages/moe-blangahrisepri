<p>We concluded Term 1 with an Inter-House Games where our students applied sports skills and knowledge learnt during House Practice in a competitive setting.</p>
<p>Our P3 students participated in a Walk-A-Jog at Telok Blangah Hill Park. This was a first for them as they enjoyed a challenging yet fun route planned by our teachers.</p>
<p>Our P4 students competed in 3v3 basketball tournament while our P5 and P6 students competed in 3v3 Floorball games.</p>
<p>Through the Inter-House Games, the students brought out the best in their teammates as well as their opponents. They displayed sportsmanship and character excellence.</p>
<p>Delta House’ s Marissa of P3 Topaz recounted, “ The P3 Walk-A-Jog was exciting for me and my friends because we got to run together in a park. The most challenging part was going up the slope. It was also very interesting because we had the opportunity to appreciate the nature around us. I look forward to the next Inter-House Games.”</p>
<p>Redhill House’s Jiyoo of P3 Opal shared, “My friends and I felt very good about the P3 Walk-A-Jog. While it was challenging going up the steep slope, my friends and I overcame the challenge by encouraging one another. I like this Walk-A-Jog. My friends and I still talk about it with excitement because of our memorable experience together.”</p>
<p>Gillman House’s Aria of P4 Topaz highlighted that the Inter-House Games was very fun. “I enjoyed playing team sports together with House members from other classes. During the Inter-House Games, the House members worked together as a team and helped one another in our passing and shooting.”</p>
<p>Keppel House’s Nathaniel of P5 Topaz added that “The Inter-House Games was fun and awesome. At first, I was nervous about playing in a competitive match. Then, I realised that there was nothing to be nervous about. I told myself to just continue playing and do what I could. While my team was average in skills, we displayed teamwork. We played against a strong team, and we won the match.”</p>
<p>Indeed, our students had displayed sportsmanship and the virtues of enthusiasm determination, perseverance and unity.</p>
<p>We look forward to our next Inter-House Games in Term 2!</p>
