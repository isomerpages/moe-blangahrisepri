<p>With the aim of enhancing students&rsquo; holistic development, all P3 to P6 students were offered Modular CCA (House System) in January 2021. Modular CCA (House System) is an after-school CCA programme that includes both supervised studies as well as sports and games. During supervised studies, students are guided by Teacher-Mentors to be self-directed learners. Middle Primary students will focus on Athletics, while Senior Primary will focus on Floorball for the sports and games segment. In both studies and sports, students help one another learn together.</p>
<p>Lee Hanbyul and Koh Zi Li are classmates, and from the same House, Delta. During Modular CCA (House System), Hanbyul and Zi Li will complete their homework before going for Floorball training together. Koh Zi Li (5S) shared,&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;During supervised study programme, Hanbyul will volunteer to help me in my school work. Her guidance helps me learn better and I am very grateful to her.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Mohamed Shahan (3 Topaz, Redhill) also shared,&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;I like House Practice because I can do my homework before participating in sports and games. This is good because I can finish my homework in school. I like my House teachers and friends.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
