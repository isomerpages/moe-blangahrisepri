<p>To promote a supportive learning environment leading up to the upcoming
Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE), Primary 6 students attended
a motivational camp geared towards nurturing determination, resilience
and providing students with a broader perspective on their educational
journey.</p>
<p>A key component of this camp involved a collaborative partnership with
JA Singapore. JA Singapore, with its focus on real-world skills and career
preparedness, provided enriching learning experiences to enhance the camp's
impact. The partnership facilitated interactions between Primary 6 students
and industry professionals. These interactions exposed students to emerging
trends in various sectors and provided insights into potential career paths.
Additionally, the partnership emphasised environmental awareness and responsibility,
encouraging students to actively engage in initiatives that promote sustainability.</p>

<p>The camp began with activities designed to cultivate empathy and compassion
within the students. Students learnt about the living conditions in other
countries, particularly the challenges faced by students who lack access
to basic resources such as adequate lighting for studying. This exposure
fostered a deeper understanding of the value of education and inspired
the students to take action to help others. In a collaborative effort,
students participated in the assembly of solar-powered lights designated
for distribution in Cambodia. This hands-on activity directly aligned with
our school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) initiative, further empowering
the students. The task of assembling the solar-powered lights required
applying knowledge of electrical circuits and presented a practical challenge
for many students, particularly with the use of tools like screwdrivers.
Overcoming this challenge fostered a sense of accomplishment and adaptability.</p>
<p>Upon completion of assembling the lights, students wrote heartfelt messages
of encouragement and support to their peers in Cambodia. This aspect of
the programme strengthened the students’ sense of shared purpose and global
citizenship. The camp, in collaboration with JA Singapore, clearly boosted
the students' motivation and readiness as they advance towards their PSLE.
It was definitely an enriching learning experience!</p>
