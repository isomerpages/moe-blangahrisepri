<p>Our Blangahnites are ready to celebrate good neighbourliness this National Day! The Good Neighbourliness Movement aims to encourage Singaporeans and residents to make that commitment to be a Good Neighbour, breaking down physical and social barriers between neighbours. Blangahnites were given the Good Neighbour&rsquo;s kit earlier this week and were encouraged to tie the red ribbon in the kit on their doorknob or gate as a commitment to be a good neighbour. Victoria, a Primary 1 student, shared that after tying the ribbon, she greeted her neighbour, &ldquo;Good Morning!&rdquo; She also started putting in effort to get to know her neighbour more. Similarly, Jayden said, &ldquo;I started saying &lsquo;Hi&rsquo; to my neighbours and now we play with their cat regularly.&rdquo; Jayden feels by being a good neighbour, he has found a new playing partner! Aswant said, &ldquo;I went to help my neighbour carry his grocery bags as he was having difficulties carrying them.&rdquo; One of the simplest yet most powerful expressions of a nation&rsquo;s unity is indeed good neighbourliness. Together with our Blangahnites, let&rsquo;s take concrete steps to be a good neighbour this National Day weekend. Together, A Stronger Community, A United Nation!</p>
