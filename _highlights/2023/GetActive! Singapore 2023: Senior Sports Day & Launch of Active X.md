This year,&nbsp;Blangah Rise Primary School supported&nbsp;SportsSG in their launch of GetActive! Singapore 2023: Senior Sports Day &amp; Launch of Active X.&nbsp;

Prior to the official launch, our dance club members were invited to take part in a pairing visit to the Lions Befrienders at Meiling Centre Active Ageing Centre(Inter-gen program) on 25 July. During the visit, our students got to bond with the seniors through&nbsp;games and dance. The girls learnt to play yesteryear kampung games from the seniors and in turn, the girls taught&nbsp;the seniors the 2023 Dance of the Nation workout.&nbsp;

It was heartening to see the girls playing&nbsp;ball games with the seniors. Katie Yong of 4 Opal&nbsp;reflected,&nbsp;"It was fun playing with the uncles and aunties. We practised the virtues of care and teamwork. We took care of each other." Angie Kong of 3 Sapphire&nbsp;also shared, "This is my first time playing games with the seniors. It was fun and I really enjoyed it."&nbsp;&nbsp;

  

It was evident from the smiles all around that everyone&nbsp;had an enjoyable time.
