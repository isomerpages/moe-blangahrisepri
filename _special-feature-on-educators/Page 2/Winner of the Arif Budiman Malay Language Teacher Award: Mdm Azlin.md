<p>“I aspire to see my students looking forward to read Malay language storybooks. I believe Malay language books are a window for them to explore the world and understand the Malay culture and language in more depth,” shared Mdm Azlin.</p>
<p>As a dedicated Malay Language teacher with great pedagogical knowledge on the Malay Language, Mdm Azlin shares her passion and knowledge with her students in the classroom. In teaching the Malay Language, she often infuses ICT tools to excite and engage her students. She also designs lessons which are well-pitched to their level and builds good rapport with her students by connecting with them as a coach, a mentor and a cheerleader. As the Malay Language Coordinator, Mdm Azlin shares her knowledge with her Malay department teachers and is always looking out for more ways to value-add to the students’ learning. She also oversees Malay Language programmes to provide students with the opportunity to use the language in authentic settings.</p>
<p>One motivation that drives Mdm Azlin to do well and better each time was seeing her students make improvement in their lessons. Mdm Azlin’s words: “As long there is slight improvement in something, there is growth. This is a success that should be celebrated. Afterall, small successes are the mother of all successes.”</p>
