<p>&ldquo;Are you ready? The time starts now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone in Blangah Rise Learning Campus was engaged in&nbsp;<em>Read for Charity</em>, a charity drive conducted by the National Reading Movement. One book would be donated to selected beneficiaries for every 10 people reading for 15 minutes. In previous years, all students and staff would gather in the school hall to read. This year, because of Covid-19, the charity drive was conducted in the classrooms via Zoom.</p>
<p>Amelia, a 9-year-old student, said, &ldquo;I was able to read a book that I liked and do a good deed at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms Junaidah shared that the charity drive was a good experience for the Primary 1 students who were participating for the first time. The students brought a variety of fiction and non-fiction books. They were so engrossed in reading that they did not realise that 15 minutes was up.</p>
<p>Miss Athena added, &ldquo;The older students expressed that they were glad to be able to serve the less fortunate as a whole school community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the timer has stopped, we will continue to cultivate the love of reading in our students and develop them to become caring leaders.</p>

<p>During this unprecedented season, we have seen Singaporeans from all walks of life stepping forward to contribute to the nation in different ways.</p>
<p>According to the authorities, blood collection in the first week of the circuit breaker period dropped to less than a quarter of the usual levels. Blood stocks are required to supply transfusion needs from surgeries, general medicine, and accident and emergency cases.</p>
<p>Mr Shang, our Head of Department for PE and CCA, responded to the appeal of Singapore Red Cross and donated his blood.</p>
<p>We interviewed Mr Shang and asked him to share his experience with us.</p>
<p><em>Q: Why did you respond to the appeal for blood donation?</em></p>
<p><em>A: I used to donate blood when I was younger but somehow stopped. I feel that we can contribute to help others in different ways. If I stay healthy and can donate my blood, I would gladly do so.</em></p>
<p><em>Q: How was the blood donation experience?</em></p>
<p><em>A: Blood donation is a safe process. The average adult has 4 to 5 litres of blood. During a donation, only 350 to 450 ml of blood is drawn. That's only 10% to 12% of the total volume of blood in your body. The fluid (plasma) portion of your donated blood will be replaced in a few days. (Source: Health Science Authority)</em></p>
<p><em>Q: How did you feel after the blood donation?</em></p>
<p><em>A: I felt fine after the blood donation. I had a good dinner and went to sleep. The next day, I did a short run and felt normal. Blood donors can donate blood again after 3 months and I look forward to my next blood donation.</em></p>

<p>It has been a week since all our students returned to school. One of the activities that they look forward to every day is the unstructured playtime during recess!</p>
<p>Safe Management Measures (SMM) are adhered to during unstructured playtime. Sports implements are provided during recess where students could still have fun in a safe manner. To ensure SMM, spot markers are placed at least 2 metres apart for individual students to practise skipping or develop badminton skills.</p>
<p>After play, students would do a wipe down of the sports implements they use. They take responsibility for ensuring that the sports implements are clean and safe for another students&rsquo; use.</p>
<p>Isha, a Primary 2 student, shared, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fun. I get to use the badminton racket to control the shuttlecock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Camille, another Primary 2 student, said appreciatively, &ldquo;At least I get to play. It&rsquo;s better than not being able to play at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Phase 2, we will continue to support our students&rsquo; holistic learning and design positive school experiences. Stay safe, stay active, stay happy.</p>
