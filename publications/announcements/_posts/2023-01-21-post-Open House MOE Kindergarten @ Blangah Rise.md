Our qualified and dedicated team of teachers are trained by MOE curriculum specialists. We deliver a curriculum that has been carefully thought through and designed to lay the foundation for your child.

Our teachers work closely with the primary school to bring fun learning experiences in different times of the year. We also look towards instilling the values of honesty, care, respect and responsibility through routines and experiences in the kindergarten.

The 3 official mother tongue languages (Chinese, Malay, Tamil) are offered, and has an emphasis on listening, speaking and writing. Your child will experience learning through authentic hands on activities in class.
