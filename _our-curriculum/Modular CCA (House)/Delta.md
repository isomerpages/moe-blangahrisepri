<p>Delta Estate connects with Alexandra Canal and forms part of the Singapore River. It reminds us that while we are a House, we are also part of something larger than ourselves.</p>
<p>Delta House embodies<br /><strong>D</strong>etermination: We are focused on our goals and we finish what we start.<br /><strong>E</strong>mpathy: We understand and share the feelings of others.<br /><strong>L</strong>ove: We are kind to the people around us.<br /><strong>T</strong>olerance: We are flexible and forgiving.<br /><strong>A</strong>ccountability: We are disciplined and make responsible decisions for our growth.</p>
