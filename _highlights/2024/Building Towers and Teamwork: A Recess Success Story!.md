<h4><strong>Building Towers and Teamwork: A Recess Success Story!</strong></h4>
<p>Recess took on a whole new dimension thanks to the incredible collaboration
between our students, teachers, and the amazing Parent Support Group (PSG)!</p>
<p>With their enthusiastic support, we hosted our very first <strong>STEM Champion</strong> challenge,
opened to all Primary 1 to Primary 6 students. The objective? To construct
the tallest free standing straw tower possible using only plastic straws
and tape. Sounds simple, isn’t it? The creativity and ingenuity displayed
by our young engineers would beg to differ!</p>
<p>Armed with boundless imagination and a collaborative spirit, our students
dove headfirst into the challenge. The playground buzzed with excitement
as they experimented with different designs, tested their structural integrity
and cheered one another on. Parents from the PSG joined in the fun, offering
guidance and encouragement, fostering a truly collaborative atmosphere.</p>
<p>The 5-minute time limit added a touch of thrilling frenzy, prompting quick
thinking and innovative solutions. The results were truly awe-inspiring!
Towers of all shapes and sizes emerged, each representing the unique problem-solving
approach of its creator. Laughter filled the air as some towers wobbled
precariously before finding their balance, while others defied gravity
with their impressive height. The tallest tower built was 153 cm by our
Primary 5 students!</p>
<p>This activity was not just about building towers; it was about developing <strong>21st CC</strong> such
as <strong>critical thinking</strong>,<strong> inventive thinking</strong> and <strong>collaboration</strong> as
well as instilling the <strong>value of resilience</strong> in our students.
They learnt the importance of teamwork, perseverance and the joy of experimentation.
The event further strengthened our partnership between our school community
and the dedicated parents who are such a vital part of our success.</p>
<p>A big <strong>‘Thank You’ </strong>to the PSG for their invaluable support
in making this event a success! We look forward to hosting more collaborative
activities in the future, building connections and enriching the learning
experience for our students.</p>
