<h4><strong>Aspiring Confident Engineers (ACE) @ BRPS</strong></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>"You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him discover it in
himself."</p>
<p><em>-Galileo Galilei-</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP), also known as&nbsp;<strong>Aspiring Confident Engineers (<em>ACE</em>) @ BRPS</strong>,
anchors on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) Education
to provide our students with opportunities to work on STEM-related projects.
Students explore, investigate and ask questions through analysing problems
and solving them through real world examples.</p>
<p>This programme aims to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>leverage on STEM to create more meaningful and engaging activities that
integrate engineering and technology in Mathematics and Science;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build students’ enthusiasm in learning;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>promote 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century skills ̶ critical thinking, decision-making,
collaboration, communication, creativity; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>inculcate values – resilience, learning from failure, respect, self-discipline.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Process Cycle</strong>
</p>
<p>The school uses the ‘Engineering Design Process’ in STEM lessons to provide
structures for learning in order to scaffold children’s thinking. The process
is adopted from the Engineering is Elementary (EiE) project that was developed
by the Museum of Science in Boston.</p>

<p>STEM activity platforms, specifically those dedicated to Robotics and
Engineering-related Learning Activities (ERLA), offer valuable educational
experiences. By constructing their own robots, students engage in hands-on
applications of STEM principles, solidifying the connection between classroom
theory and real-world implementation. This process fosters innovation as
students seek to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and their
practical uses. Additionally, learning programming enhances linguistic
and logical reasoning skills. Robotics-focused education provides an engaging
and accessible introduction to fundamental engineering concepts at an early
stage in student development.</p>
<p><strong>A Tiered Approach</strong>
</p>

</div>
<p>The Applied Learning Program (ALP) is designed based on a two-tiered structure.
Tier 1 offers a comprehensive curriculum designed for all students. Tier
2 provides advanced learning opportunities for those demonstrating exceptional
aptitude and engagement in STEM disciplines. Specialised STEM activities
are conducted within our dedicated discovery spaces: Da Vinci's Workbench
and Edison's Hub.</p>
<p><strong>Tier 1 - Robotics &amp; STEM-related Project Work</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 70%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2024 Photos/ALP Webpage/ALP_4.png">
</div>
<p>As part of the Tier 1 curriculum, all students will participate in project-based
learning focused on robotics and engineering-related activities (ERLA).
In collaboration with Junior Achievement (JA) Singapore, the school provides
enriching learning experiences for students. Students will interact with
industry professionals, exploring emerging trends and gaining valuable
industry exposure. This partnership also emphasises the cultivation of
environmental awareness and responsibility through engaging activities.</p>

<p>In 2024, with the enthusiastic support of our Parent Support Group (PSG),
we introduced our STEM Champion Challenge. This program invites students
to participate in termly sessions focused on collaborative, hands-on STEM
activities. The challenges are designed to promote creative thinking, teamwork,
and the application of core STEM concepts during recess.</p>

<p>The school consistently participates in the biannual STEM Playground Challenge,
a collaborative initiative organised by the Science Centre Singapore and
the James Dyson Foundation. This program challenges students to engage
in independent problem-solving through a series of STEM-based activities.
School performance is evaluated based on two key metrics: student participation
rates and social media engagement. The school achieved recognition as one
of the top five primary schools in Singapore for demonstrating the highest
student participation rate in the recent challenge.</p>
