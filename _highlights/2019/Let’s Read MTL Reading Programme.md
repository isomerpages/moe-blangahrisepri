<p>"Let’s Read MTL Reading Programme” took place on 5 November. Our P6 students buddied our MK K2 students and took on the role of little teachers as they read stories to them. Through this programme, our P6 students displayed confidence and resilience as they guided our young readers and shared their love for reading.</p>
