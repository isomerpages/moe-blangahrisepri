  **Champion Scrabbles at the 22nd Inter-School National Scrabble Championship 2023**

Our Scrabblers have once again emerged victorious with a collection of medals at this yearâ€™s in-person 22nd Inter-School National Scrabble Championship 2023. Many of our players are greenhorns from Primary 3. Despite the jitters from their first-ever exposure to a competitive environment, our young Scrabblers displayed true grit as they tried to outwit their invisible opponents on the other end of the virtual space.

They performed remarkably well, taking home awards from both the Individual and Team events. In the Junior Division, Minh Anh (3S) emerged first in the Plate category while Koo Seo Jun (3T), Hong Jiyoo (3O), Chu Po-wei (3T), and Soon Cai Jun (4T) clinched second positions in the Premier Cup, Cup, Plate Categories. In the Senior Division, Kayden Chu clinched the first position in the Plate Category!

More impressively, in the Team Event, our teams came up Champions and 1st Runners Up in the Junior Division. With their memorised Latin, Greek roots and two-letter words, our Scrabblers rose to the challenge against students from many other schools. View all our achievements below. We are mighty proud of all our Scrabblers!
