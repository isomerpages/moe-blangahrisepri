<p>The Caring Teacher Awards (CTA) celebrate educators who exemplify care
and compassion in their teaching, going beyond the call of duty to nurture
the holistic development of their students. These dedicated teachers play
a vital role in shaping confident, independent, and resilient learners
who contribute meaningfully to our nation. The closing date for nominations
is on 31 December 2025. We would like to invite you and your child/ward
to submit your nomination for one or more deserving teachers. Your nomination
will be a source of encouragement for the teachers.</p>
