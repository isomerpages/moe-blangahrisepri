<p><strong>P2 Robotics: Coding with KUBO<br /></strong>&ldquo;Robotics is really fun,&rdquo; shared Raman from 2 Ruby. &ldquo;We can programme KUBO to do things and move around the map.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s digital age, the importance of coding is undeniable. Our robotics programme thus focuses on skills such as computational thinking, problem solving and logical reasoning. Our P2 students explored these skills via coding with KUBO. Building on the foundation of block coding they learnt the year before, students learnt how to use the record tagtile during their PAL lessons. This challenged students to code in a linear fashion, as compared to the more diagrammatic and visual method which they had learnt in P1. Undeterred, our students rose to the challenge and successfully navigated KUBO through a map of a beach whilst coding in a linear fashion.</p>
<p>The programme also employs the Writing Experience approach and provides a unique opportunity for students to craft a short story of KUBO&rsquo;s day at the beach after completing the programming. This unique experience helps provide a genuine experience which forms the basis for students to complete their writing.</p>

<p><strong>P6 STEM: Making a Solar Oven<br /></strong>Our P6 students had the opportunity to be exposed to materials engineering concepts when completing a STEM activity held during the school&rsquo;s annual P6 Motivation Camp. Drawing on their knowledge of Mathematics and Science that they had picked up from the school&rsquo;s curriculum as well as enrichment programmes, they were tasked to build a device that could heat up food using solar energy from the Sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We learnt to use clear plastic wrap to cover the device to trap the warm air inside,&rdquo; said Dyea from 6 Topaz.</p>
<p>Working in groups, students came together to problem solve and make scientific decisions on suitable materials that could be used as well as coming up with creative designs that could harness the Sun&rsquo;s solar energy efficiently. In the process of working together, students also learnt to cooperate and communicate with one another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the process, we learnt that aluminium foil is a suitable material for the task as it is able to gain heat quickly,&rdquo; said Mikhael from 6 Topaz.</p>

<p><strong>P5 Robotics: Beach Clean-up<br /></strong>As part of ALP, our students given the opportunities to explore and work together to solve real-world problems. In Term 2, P5 students were tasked with a STEM-related robotics project titled &ldquo;Beach Clean-up&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Using the &lsquo;Engineering Design Process&rsquo;, students had to make use of 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century skills such as critical thinking, decision-making, communication and creativity to construct and program a robot to clean up the beach. Students not only had fun using Lego to build their robot, but they also learnt how to program their robot using the WeDo 2.0 software. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad we were given the opportunity to work together to create robots to clean the beach. Although there were some disagreements at the start regarding the design of the robot, we managed to iron out our differences and agree on how our robot should look like. In the process, I learnt how to communicate better and I think this will help me when I do group work in the classroom,&rdquo; shared Nathan Tham from 5 Topaz.</p>
