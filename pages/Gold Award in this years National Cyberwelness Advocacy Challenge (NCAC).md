<p>Congratulations to our Cyber Wellness Ambassadors &ndash; Alara, Sophia, Devesh and Hidayat &ndash; from Primary 4 Sapphire for attaining the Gold Award in this year&rsquo;s National Cyberwellness Advocacy Challenge (NCAC).</p>
<p>The theme for the challenge this year was &ldquo;Fake News: Spot It, Evaluate It, Remove It!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To learn more about the topic, our Cyber Wellness Ambassadors took part in an online training camp where they learnt pertinent Cyber Wellness issues and content from experts and consultants in the field. &ldquo;I learnt that it is important to watch out for fake news,&rdquo; Alara shared, &ldquo;if we trust or believe fake news, it can hurt us and our family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The team then designed and created an innovative toolkit &ndash; &ldquo;Are you S.U.R.E?&rdquo; &ndash; based on a popular board game, Monopoly. The toolkit was used in a three-pronged approach to target classes, levels and families. Each class received a toolkit, allowing students to engage in either guided or self-directed play. The toolkit was also placed in the mini-library, allowing students to play it during their level recesses. In addition, with the help of the Parent Support Group, families loaned the toolkit and played the game as a family at home. Through the toolkit, students, as well as their families, learnt ways to tell real and fake news apart.</p>
<p>It was a wonderful experience for the school and our Cyber Wellness Ambassadors. Hidayat shared his enjoyment of the experience, saying, &ldquo;I like that we could be creative. I would like to take part in the challenge again if it continues next year!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well done to our Cyber Wellness Ambassadors!</p>
