In alignment with our commitment to foster 21st-century competencies and further develop the talents and proficiencies of our students, the English Department recently conducted a Broadcast Journalism module as part of its Oracy Package for Primary 3 and 4 students. The primary objective of this programme was to enrich the oracy skills of our students through immersive learning experiences and hands-on practice.

During the module, our Primary 3 students received targeted instruction in the art of clearly and succinctly expressing their ideas, thoughts, and news stories in a podcast format. They had the opportunity to share insights about their favourite places within the school environment.

Reflecting on their learning journey, Andrew remarked, "Before we attended the Broadcast Journalism sessions, we engaged in self-directed learning through the use of Student Learning Space (SLS). We learnt new vocabulary words which we could use in our podcasts. We then applied these words in our script writing process." 

Pandora elaborated on the integration with the English Language curriculum, stating, "Using our scripts, our English Language teacher got us to do a voice recording using the iPads. This allowed me to practise reading my script aloud. I could listen to my own recording and make improvements based on the feedback given by my teacher. This helped to build up my confidence when I had to do the actual recording for the podcast.”
In parallel, our Primary 4 students focused on honing their scriptwriting skills, with an emphasis on delivering well-rounded, accurate, and informative content for video broadcasts. They showcased their proficiency by presenting on their favourite school programmes.

Throughout the programme, students acquired valuable presentation skills, including effective verbal and non-verbal communication techniques, and the ability to speak with confidence, incorporating voice projection, clear articulation, and intonation. Rizqah shared her enthusiasm, "I really enjoyed the Broadcast Journalism sessions, especially the videos that the trainer showed. From the sessions, I learnt how to use more impactful words in my script and most importantly how to stand properly and project my voice when doing presentations.”

Through the Broadcast Journalism module, our students have been provided with invaluable opportunities to develop as active contributors, confident individuals, and self-directed learners, preparing them for success in the dynamic world of communication and media.
