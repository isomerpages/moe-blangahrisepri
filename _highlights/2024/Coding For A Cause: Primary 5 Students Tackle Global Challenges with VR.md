<p>Our Primary 5 students recently embarked on an exciting journey into the
world of technology and social impact through the JA Fun with AR/VR Coding
Programme. In partnership with JA Singapore, this programme empowers students
to combine their passion for coding and design thinking to address real-world
issues outlined in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>
<p>Through interactive sessions, students gained hands-on experience using
CoSpaces Edu to build Virtual Reality (VR) worlds, learning the fundamentals
of coding and design. They delved into the pressing global challenges addressed
by the SDGs, sparking critical thinking and innovative solutions. Collaboratively,
students identified SDGs they felt strongly about and crafted immersive
VR presentations to showcase their inventive ideas.</p>

<p>Natalie and her team from 5 Topaz tackled the issue of climate action,
recognising the urgency to reduce reliance on air conditioners. Their VR
world showcased a city brimming with green spaces, particularly on buildings,
as a natural cooling solution to combat rising temperatures.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ethan and his team from 5 Sapphire also focused on climate
action, proposing a shift towards solar energy. Their VR city featured
solar panels integrated into every building, harnessing Singapore's abundant
sunlight for sustainable electricity.</p>
<p>Audrey and her 5 Sapphire team addressed the goal of zero hunger by designing
a network of food drop-off points in neighborhoods. Their VR world vividly
illustrated how easily these points could look like, facilitating the sharing
of surplus food with those in need.</p>

<p>This programme not only equipped students with valuable coding skills
but also helped develop essential 21st-Century Competencies emphasised
by MOE, including communication and collaboration skills and critical thinking.
Additionally, the project nurtured our students’ adaptability and inventive
thinking as they explored novel solutions to global challenges. We are
proud of our students’ enthusiasm and the meaningful contributions they
have made towards a more sustainable future.</p>
