<p>In their larval stage, which can last up to two years,&nbsp;dragonflies&nbsp;are aquatic and eat just about anything &ndash; tadpoles, mosquitoes, fish, other insect larvae and even each other. True or False?</p>

<p>This &ldquo;True or False&rdquo; activity on our local species of dragonflies was just one of the activities at BRPS&rsquo;s booth at Singapore Botanic Gardens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the Festival of Biodiversity 2022, which was held on 21 and 22 May, our Student Leaders engaged members of the public on&nbsp;environmental issues, and how we can all play a part in caring for the green spaces and wildlife around us. They also had the opportunity to publicise our newly published children&rsquo;s book, &ldquo;The Green Dragonflies and Their Swampy Friends&rdquo;. At the booth, our Student Leaders showcased the photographs on Our Environment, which were taken by our very own Blangahnites during the Young Photographers programme. The photographs demonstrated how our Young Photographers leveraged on their photographs to tell compelling stories and perspectives through their lenses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our Student Leaders had an enriching experience at Singapore Botanic Gardens. Gail, Primary 5, shared, &ldquo;I had not managed a booth before and this was a new experience for me. I was nervous at the beginning but I overcame that. After interacting with more people, my confidence level grew! I enjoyed sharing my knowledge about dragonflies and the environment with the visitors. This was an enriching learning experience that took place out of the classroom. I will always remember this day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruvanthigaa, a Student Leader who managed the booth with Gail, reflected, &ldquo;I have learnt more about the environment and biodiversity when preparing for the booth and interacting with the visitors. I would like to do more research on dragonflies so that I can extend my learning!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This platform has given our Student Leaders a platform to hone their oral communication skills in an authentic platform. It has also sparked their interest to learn more about the environment and biodiversity and how they can play a part in caring for Mother Earth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Besides the booth activities, our Student Leaders also conducted storytelling and craft sessions on both days at Singapore Botanic Gardens, and library@harbourfront on 21 May. Both sessions were well-received. One of the storytellers, Devesh shared that he was more confident in his storytelling on 21 May, as compared to the first session held on 7 May. He no longer had stage fright and was confident in putting forth his thoughts from then on.
