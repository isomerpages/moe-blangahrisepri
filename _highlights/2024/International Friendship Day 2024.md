<h4><strong>International Friendship Day 2024</strong></h4>
<p>We commemorated International Friendship Day on 2 April.</p>
<p>There were activities which aimed to foster friendships and collaborations
amongst our students. Our student emcees, Dave and Mia shared with everyone
the theme for International Friendship Day - Singapore in Asia. Dave and
Mia emphasised the importance of Singapore’s role in shaping the region
and fostering strong bonds with our neighbouring countries.</p>

<p>Mahasina from Primary 4 said, "From the activities, I had learnt about
different cultures and how we could be friends with people from all over
the world."</p>
<p>Zi Han Primary 2 shared that she had learnt a lot about Laos and it is
a very colourful country. She hoped that she would be able to visit Laos
one day!</p>
<p>One of the highlights from our activities was the student-led quizzes.
It provided students with the opportunity to apply knowledge gleaned from
the sharing by Dave and Mia. It was also a platform for all students to
extend their learning.</p>

<p>“The quiz during the assembly was very entertaining and informative. It
was all about forging good relations and why it was important to work together.
It was fun and helped us remember important learning points,” said Judith
from Primary 6.</p>

<p>During our FTGP lessons, the teachers had the opportunity to learn more
about the Laos culture, gaining a greater appreciation for the rich tapestry
of traditions that make up our region.</p>
<p>The commemoration of International Friendship Day served as a powerful
reminder of our role as global citizens. It encouraged us to foster friendships
beyond borders and develop the spirit of camaraderie amongst all of us.
Happy International Friendship Day!</p>
