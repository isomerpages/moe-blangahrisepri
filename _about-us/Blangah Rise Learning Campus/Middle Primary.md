<p>Welcome to the Middle Primary (Primary 3 and 4) webpage!</p>
<p>The Middle Primary is a robust team formed by talented and creative teachers who will combine their strengths, skills and ideas to work together to enrich your child’s time in school. My colleagues and I aim to nurture your child to the best of our abilities. We believe in establishing a strong partnership and an open communication with parents.</p>

<p>A note to parents from the Year Heads,</p>
<p>Dear Parents, our role is to look into all student development matters including general discipline matters and provide intervention strategies where necessary. In addition, we will monitor the Middle Primary students’ progress and work together with the teachers to address areas of growth for your child so as to give your child a positive school experience this year.</p>
<p>Thank you for your partnership and support in your child’s education. We look forward to an exciting year of learning and growth for your child.</p>
