<p>Our school was invited to take part in the Singapore Red Cross Grateful Hearts Day 2020 .&nbsp;Aimed to multiply the power of humanity, the campaign presents a meaningful opportunity for families, friends, neighbors and colleagues to come together to raise funds to support the vulnerable in Singapore.&nbsp; It was a meaningful experience for our students as they helped to collect donations from their fellow peers. Students took this opportunity to contribute back to the community and we were presented with a Certificate of Appreciation&nbsp;from the Singapore Red Cross for our fundraising efforts and support!</p>
