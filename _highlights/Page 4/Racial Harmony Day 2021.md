<p>&ldquo;I enjoyed drawing the face of my classmate. We look very similar!!&rdquo; exclaimed Leane, a Primary 1 student.</p>
<p>As part of our Racial Harmony Day celebrations, our Primary 1 and 2 students took part in the &ldquo;Draw Your Partner&rdquo; activity where they learnt to observe the similarities between them and their classmates.</p>
<p>This year, we celebrated Racial Harmony Day on 8 July with the theme &ldquo;Common Spaces, Connected Communities&rdquo;. Students learnt to employ the habits of being proactive and seeking first to understand than to be understood in managing race relations.</p>
<p>While our Primary 1 and 2 students drew each other and celebrated their differences, our Primary 3 to Primary 6 students took part in the &ldquo;Bias Game&rdquo; to explore and address the idea of&nbsp;<em>fairness</em>. &ldquo;I realised that when things are unfair, people will be upset. So, I learnt that that we should speak up if we see people being treated unfairly,&rdquo; shared Jing Lin from Primary 4.</p>
<p>A harmony jar was also given to all classes. When students complete practical small tasks related to learning about another race, they help to fill the harmony jar belonging to their class. This provided a visual representation to students that all of them have a part to play in racial harmony.</p>
<p>All these activities promoted inter-racial understanding and friendships. Through them, students learnt to appreciate each other&rsquo;s differences and respect diversity in order to build harmony in the school regardless of race, language or religion.</p>
