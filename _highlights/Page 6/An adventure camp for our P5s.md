<p>Our three-day Primary 5 Adventure Camp was held on 17-19 February this year, at the MOE Dairy Farm Outdoor Adventure Learning Centre. The camp allowed students to step out of their comfort zones to lead and work in teams. In line with our school&rsquo;s virtues education, opportunities to display virtues of respect, responsibility, and resilience were also deliberately built into camp activities.</p>
<p>Led by MOE&rsquo;s Outdoor Adventure Educators (OAEs) and school teachers, our P5 students embarked on a journey towards self-discovery. One of the highlights of the camp was the hike to the Singapore Quarry and Wallace Education Centre, where students got the opportunity to see animals such as wild boars, macaques, woodpeckers, and monitor lizards in the wild. They displayed resilience and cheered their teammates on during the long hike. Mikhael shared, &ldquo;I showed care for my friends when they got tired during the hike. My friends also encouraged me to persevere throughout the journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another highlight of the camp was longkang fishing, and our students were thrilled at the opportunity to fish for guppies with their bare hands. In Furqan&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;I enjoyed longkang fishing because I have never gone fishing like that before!&rdquo; Many students shared that they learnt the virtue of patience which was tested as they had to wait for the fishes to swim towards them.</p>
<p>Team-bonding games included tent-pitching, where students had to try and pitch a tent together as a team with limited instructions. Our P5 students learnt to think on their feet to work and solve problems together.</p>
<p>Our students were enthusiastic and in high spirits throughout the camp. At the end of the camp, they cemented their friendships with the making of concrete art, and gifted it to a teammate. The artwork served as a keepsake for their shared memories in the camp. The camp was meaningful time spent with their friends and they learnt many valuable life lessons that would stay with them for a long time.</p>
