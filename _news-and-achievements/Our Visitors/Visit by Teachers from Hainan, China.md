<p>On 16 July 2019, we hosted a group of English Language teachers from Hainan. Through this professional exchange, the teachers from Hainan gleaned useful ideas on the teaching of the English Language and ways to harness technology to enhance teaching and learning.</p>
<p>The teachers from Hainan observed lessons across different levels and had a conference with the teachers who conducted the lessons. Ms Magdalene Ho conducted a Primary 6 lesson on nets of a cube and leveraged on Student Learning Space (SLS) to form different nets of a cube and cuboid. Down in a Primary 1 class, Ms Maddie Wong got her students excited about learning vocabulary using HP Reveal and Nearpod. Mdm Uuchi assessed her students&rsquo; learning of irregular past tense verbs using Kahoot! The teachers from Hainan were impressed with how the use of ICT could enable students to be active and self-directed learners.</p>
<p>All in all, it was an engaging and fruitful session which provided the teachers from Hainan new ideas and perspectives. We wish them all the best!</p>
