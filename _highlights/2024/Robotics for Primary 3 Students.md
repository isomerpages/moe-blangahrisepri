<p>Our Primary 3 students recently embarked on a thrilling 5-session adventure
in the "Let's Keep Cool!" Robotics programme in Week 9 and 10. This exciting
initiative tackled climate change head-on, blending Science, Mathematics,
technology and innovation.</p>
<p>The programme kicked off with students researching about climate change
and exploring the wonders of robots. They learned how robots could be used
for environmental solutions. Equipped with Lego SPIKE kits, they built
and programmed "Spinning Ferris Wheel" robots, laying the foundation for
future creations.</p>

<p>Session 3 delved deeper into Science and Mathematics. Students explored
the concept of temperature, learning how to use a thermometer to measure
and read it accurately. Through hands-on activities, they discovered how
heat transfers, a crucial concept in understanding climate change. This
knowledge then fueled their ultimate project â€“ building a "Cooling Fan"
robot! Sessions 4 and 5 culminated in a thrilling Robotics Challenge. Students
put their "Cooling Fan" robots to the test, racing to cool down hot water
the fastest. But it wasn't just about speed! They programmed their robots
for optimal efficiency and meticulously measured water temperature at set
intervals. This session fostered teamwork, adaptive and inventive thinking.
Students also applied math skills where they saw how line graphs could
be used as a form of graphical representation to analyse data over a period
of time. The programme concluded with students proudly showcasing their
robots' cooling performance and data analysis.</p>

<p>This Primary 3 Robotics programme not only equipped our students with
robotics programming skills and fostered collaboration, but also ignited
a passion for creating solutions for a cooler planet, while integrating
valuable Mathematics elements.</p>
