<p><strong>A note from the Acting Year Head, Mdm Kimberly Koh and Assistant Year Head, Mr John Chia<br /></strong>Welcome to Junior Primary!</p>
<p>This is an exciting time of learning and growing for your child / ward where&nbsp;<strong>we grow deep and grow together</strong>.&nbsp;We are committed to providing the best learning environment to help your child /ward enjoy every moment of learning in school, both within and beyond the classroom.</p>
<p>The formative years of education is very important, thus to help your child /ward develop the learning dispositions needed to become effective individuals, we grow your child / ward to be proactive learners. We nurture their&nbsp;<strong>curiosity</strong>&nbsp;about the world and help them enjoy learning new things with&nbsp;<strong>enthusiasm</strong>. We give them skills to work towards their learning goals in a disciplined manner. When they encounter difficulties, we encourage them&nbsp;<strong>to keep trying and not give up</strong>. We encourage them to learn together with their peers and&nbsp;<strong>collaborate as a team</strong>. In this way, your child / ward can truly experience&nbsp;<strong>the joy of learning</strong>!</p>
<p>Our children succeed when parents / guardians and schools work hand in hand. Therefore, we look forward to your close partnership to bring out the best in your child / ward!</p>

<p><strong>A Taste of Robotics &amp; Engineering for our Primary 1!<br /></strong>Building a smart nation is one of Singapore&rsquo;s top priorities in a bid to keep the city-state relevant in the digital age. STEM education imparts knowledge to students in the disciplines of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. Our Primary 1 students got to take part in STEM activities which consist of Robotics and Engineering-related Learning Activities (ERLA).</p>
<p>To equip our students with coding literacy and computational thinking skills, students took part in the KUBO Robotics and ScratchJr Program. Through this program, students learnt about coding with KUBO. Each student had a hands-on experience using the Kubo kit which consists of a small robot (KUBO) and a set of puzzle pieces (Tagtiles) that fit together to create programming chains. Students explored different coding functions and programmed their robots to move. Putting on their thinking caps, students successfully navigated KUBO through a map and avoided given obstacles. Students also got creative and designed costumes for their KUBO robots and programmed them to move in a KUBO Costume Parade!</p>

<p>On the other hand, students were engaged in a coding application called ScratchJr. With ScratchJr, students learnt to program their own interactive stories. In the process, they learn to solve problems, design characters, and express themselves creatively. Students unleashed their imagination as they made their characters come to life. They programmed their characters to move, jump, dance and speak using programming blocks. Students especially enjoyed how they could customise characters and backgrounds using the paint editor.</p>

<p>Through ERLA, our students had the experience of becoming young aerospace engineers. Students were briefed about NASA plans to explore the surface of Mars using a rover in combination with a lightweight helicopter. To explore how helicopters operate, students built their very own paper helicopters. They learnt that as air flows over a spinning helicopter blade, it generates a net upward push, called lift. Moreover, students experimented on factors that can also influence lift such as changing the shape or length of the blades. They reflected on how they could improve the design like NASA engineers did when making the first helicopter for planet Mars.</p>

<p><strong>P2 ERLA Activity: Parachute Making<br /></strong>Our P2 students were taken back in time to 1969 where astronauts first landed on the moon but with a twist: The astronauts are stranded on the moon! Our students bravely took up the challenge as aerospace engineers on a mission to bring these astronauts back to Earth safely.</p>
<p>Students went through the Engineering Design Process Cycle where they worked with their peers to brainstorm possible solutions and planned out their ideas. Next, they designed their parachutes using given materials. Students had to decide on materials which can help land objects safely. Students were most excited when the time came to test out their parachutes. Indeed, it was a fun and engaging learning process for our students where they were given opportunities to explore and reflect on improvements they could make on their parachute design.</p>
<p>On her experience, Heidi, from Primary 2 Sapphire said, &ldquo;It was fun making our own parachutes! I was excited to test if our parachutes worked!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jayden from Primary 2 Topaz had a similar experience shared, &ldquo;We brought the astronauts safely back to Earth! I am proud of our parachute design!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Do you know that a sixth pillar of&nbsp;<em>Digital Defence has been added</em><em>&nbsp;</em>to the existing five pillars of<em>&nbsp;Military, Civil, Economic, Social, Digital and Psychological Defence?</em></p>
<p><em>Our Junior Primary students learnt about Singapore&rsquo;s past and how they can be proactive in playing their part&nbsp;</em>to help strengthen our country against future threats and challenges. Ameer, our P1 student, was inspired through the activities. He said, &ldquo;I want to be a policeman when I grow up so that I can keep Singapore safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Zoo Goes to School</strong></p>

<p>Ranger Ooz visited BRPS and took our P1 students on a journey to discover amazing wild animals big and small. Students also had a chance to come up close and personal to discover nature. Qistina exclaimed, &ldquo;It was the first time I got to see and touch a stick insect!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Following &ldquo;Zoo Goes to School&rdquo;, our P1 students went on the Fragile Forest Guided Tour at the Singapore Zoo for a multi-dimensional experience of life in a rainforest ecosystem. They walked amidst fascinating flora and came face to face with lemurs, butterflies, birds, snails and more. As part of our Learning for Life Programme, our students also learnt about the importance of rainforests to mankind and thought about ways we could save them.</p>
<p>The visit ended with the exciting Animal Friends Show which opened the eyes of our students to the special skills and important roles that domesticated animals play in our lives. Camille recalled, &ldquo;It was fun to represent my school and see the animals up close!&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Career Exploration Month</strong></p>

<p>BRPS invited professionals including an accountant, a chef and a dietician, a doctor and an engineer to provide authentic hands-on experiences for our students. Our students became more aware of different careers and learnt about their own interests and strengths.</p>
<p>Zheng Hao, a P1 student, recounted, &ldquo;Now I know what the doctors are listening to when they check me. I want to be like them when I grow up.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>BRPS Commemorates Racial Harmony Day</strong></p>
<img src="/images/Photo-13-1024x683.jpg">
<p>Our Junior Primary students came dressed in their traditional ethnic costumes and learnt the importance of maintaining&nbsp;racial&nbsp;and religious&nbsp;harmony&nbsp;in Singapore's multicultural and multi-ethnic society. They practised the habit of &ldquo;seeking first to understand, then to be understood&rdquo; through the assembly show and games.</p>
<p>Nurgazyz, a P2 student, reflected, &ldquo;I am from another country and I am impressed to see how the different races in Singapore get along well with one another.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Readers&rsquo; Theatre</strong></p>

<img src="/images/Photo-15-1.jpg">
<p>A play by students for students. Our P2 students came together to decide on a play which they would like to perform to our P1 students. Through the process, our P2 students learned to work together with their peers and continued to improve on their play after each performance.</p>
<p>Lucas, a P2 student, recounted, &ldquo;It was not easy to speak slowly when I played the role of the tortoise because my friends had to wait for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drayson, a P1 student, shared, &ldquo;I know the story and it was funny when the Primary 2 students acted it out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We are privileged to be one of the 18 primary schools with an MOE Kindergarten. In Term 4, we have an array of activities lined up for our MOE Kindergarten children, from going on a school tour around the &ldquo;big&rdquo; primary school, to classroom experiences as well as conducting interviews with our primary school Principal and staff.</p>
<p>Our P1 student, Kashia, said, &ldquo;I am happy I can help my K2 friend know more about my class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more exciting updates!</p>
