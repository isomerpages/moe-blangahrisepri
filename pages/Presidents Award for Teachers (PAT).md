<p>The President&rsquo;s Award for Teachers (PAT) recognises excellent educators for their role in moulding the future of our nation. This year, Mr James Han is one of the 17 2021 PAT finalists. The award recognises caring and nurturing educators committed to developing their students to their fullest potential and constantly adopting innovative approaches in their lessons. One of the areas that Mr Han was recognised for was his work in the implementation of The Virtues Project, a popular international framework of 52 virtues, that has been adapted for Blangah Rise Primary School in 2020. The framework was intended to reshape teacher-student relationships and help students be more engaged in their learning. To do that, the Five Strategies of the Virtues Project are used. At the heart of it, Mr Han and his fellow teachers in Blangah Rise Primary School are striving to be better mentors to their students. Our congratulations goes to Mr Han as a 2021 PAT finalist!</p>
