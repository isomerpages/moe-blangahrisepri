<p>Did you know that the Mid-Autumn Festival, known as Chuseok in Korea,
is one of Korea's most significant holidays? In Vietnam, people celebrate
with a special feast tray featuring five types of colorful fruits, while
in Japan, the full moon is called "Chusyu no Meigetsu," meaning "harvest
moon." Through a presentation, our students learnt about how their peers
in Vietnam, Korea, and Japan celebrate this traditional festival in their
unique ways.</p>

<p>Our MOE Kindergarten students delighted the audience with a graceful dance
performance, swaying along to the melodious music while holding their beautiful
lanterns. Dylan from 4 Opal and Lam Khai from 4 Topaz shared the legend
behind one of the festival's most iconic elements—the mooncake. Deeksha
from 4 Sapphire shared how she discovered that mooncakes come with different
fillings, and how cultures across the world have their own ways of celebrating
this festival.</p>
<p>The BRPS CL Idols, along with some of our Primary 2 and Primary 4 students,
sang a song which painted a vivid picture of the festival and conveyed
themes of reunion and longing. Our Primary 5 Chinese Language students
showcased an impressive Allegro performance using bamboo clappers, delivering
a captivating rendition of a traditional poem.</p>

<p>Our Primary 1 students danced to a timeless tune inspired by the poem
"静夜诗" (Quiet Night Thoughts) by the famous poet Li Bai. The poem reflected
on the bright moon and the longing for home, perfectly encapsulates the
essence of the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>

<p>Danish from 4 Topaz shared that he especially enjoyed the story of the
mooncakes, while Ruqia from 3 Topaz said she enjoyed the performance by
our MOE Kindergarten students.</p>
<p>In the lead-up to the celebration, students enjoyed riddle-guessing in
our mini-library and crafted their own lanterns using recycled bottles.
Our creative parents from the Parent Support Group also contributed by
decorating the whiteboard outside the General Office with festive designs.</p>
<p>The celebration reminded us of the special traditions that connect us
all. As we enjoy the different ways of celebrating, we wish everyone a
happy and meaningful Mid-Autumn Festival!</p>
