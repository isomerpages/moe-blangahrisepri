<p>The STEM Challenge is back again with an even tougher task: constructing
a chair using cardboard without adhesives. This challenge emphasized principles
of structural engineering and innovative problem-solving. Despite the increased
difficulty, approximately 70% of participants successfully completed the
challenge. Congratulations to our young engineers for demonstrating their
ingenuity, problem-solving abilities and application of scientific principles!
