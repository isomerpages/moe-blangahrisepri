<p>Gail Lien Zhao Xin studied at Blangah Rise Primary School (BRPS) from
2018 to 2023. During her six years at BRPS, Gail had a very enriching and
fulfilling school experience. She participated in STEM projects, Junior
Reporters, Math Olympiad, Inter-school Debate, SYF Dance, NSG Track &amp;
Field and more. She also served as a School Prefect and Dance CCA Leader.
<br>
<br>In this latest Alumni Series feature, Gail shares how her wholesome primary
school experience prepared her transition for secondary school. Even as
Gail continues to flourish at secondary school, she would like to encourage
her BRPS juniors to step out of their comfort zone, be open to try new
things, be resilient and be self-disciplined.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
