<p>On 20 January 2025, our Scouts organised sports and games for more than
40 seniors at Telok Blangah Community Club.</p>
<p>Guided by their CCA teachers, the Scouts worked in small groups to engage
the seniors. While the Scouts came with many planned activities, they quickly
learnt to adapt these activities to better meet the needs of the seniors.</p>

<p>Batrisyia from 6 Sapphire said, "I enjoyed CCA VIA with the seniors. As
we organised the games, we had to adapt our activities based on the seniors'
abilities. For example, we simplified the games to suit their energy levels
and enhance participation. This taught us to consider their comfort and
safety while engaging them positively. I felt a deep sense of fulfillment
giving instructions and interacting with them; their smiles were truly
uplifting. I would definitely encourage my friends and family to engage
in community service - it is a rewarding experience for all."</p>
<p>We are grateful for this monthly opportunity to foster community building
in Telok Blangah. May all our students continue to be inspired to serve
the community as they live out the spirit of learning and growing through
CCA VIA.</p>
