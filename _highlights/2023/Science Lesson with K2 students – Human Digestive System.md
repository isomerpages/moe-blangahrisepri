<p>Teachers from the Science Department conducted a lesson for the K2 students on the Human Digestive System. They were taught how food they eat is transformed into the energy they use every day.</p>
<p>Using visuals aids and resources like strings, tennis ball and foldable paper ball, the teachers helped students relate and understand the different parts in the digestive system and their functions as well as the digestive process.</p>
<p>To enhance the experience, the students were ‘treated’ to marshmallows. They observed how their teeth and saliva play an important part in speeding up the digestive process. The students were able to see how the parts of a system work together to support the life processes taking place in the human body.</p>
<p>The students also learnt that the human body require healthy foods and plenty of water in order to work right to give it the energy needed for work and play. They were encouraged to eat a balanced diet and practise good hygiene. This was definitely an enriching learning experience which engaged our students to relate Science concepts to their lives.</p>
