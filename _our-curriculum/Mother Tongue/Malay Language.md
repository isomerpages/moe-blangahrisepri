<p><strong>Department:&nbsp;</strong>Malay Unit (Mother Tongue Department)<br><strong>Vision:&nbsp;</strong>Every child is able to use the Malay language effectively.<br><strong>Mission:&nbsp;</strong>To nurture passion and love for the Malay language and the Malay culture in our students.</p>
<h4><strong>Description of Programmes:</strong></h4>
<p><strong><em>Teaching &amp; Learning<br></em></strong>In our Malay Language classes, a variety of strategies are adopted to enhance our students’ learning and to provide them with opportunities to demonstrate thinking and communication skills. Students not only learn through textbooks but also through experiential learning to make learning valuable for students. Students are involved in collaborative work. In addition, during recess, our students also get to extend their learning by reading a storybook and doing a follow-up activity based on the storybook selected. 
Higher Malay Language is offered at the Primary 3 level. Students extend their learning of the Malay language. They are exposed to Malay Literature such as pantun, puisi and cerpen. They also conduct simple research about the Malay culture.

<p><strong><em>Inquiry-Based Learning<br></em></strong>Through Inquiry-based Learning (IBL), our students engage in self-directed and collaborative learning. IBL, paired with authentic learning, promotes critical and inventive thinking skills in our students as they attempt to solve real-world problems. For instance, our students explored and learnt about puppet making using socks as a prop for their story-telling in class. Some of our students designed their version of batik and even researched about the origin of batik.</p>
