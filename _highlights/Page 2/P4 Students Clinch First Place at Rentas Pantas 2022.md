<p>Our Primary 4 students &ndash; Fatin Khalisya, Nur Wani Rindiani, Achmad Dani, Achmad Daniel and Nur Zyla Shaziqah represented our school in Rentas Pantas 2022. Rentas Pantas, an event organised by Nanyang Technological University / National Institute of Education's Malay Language and Cultural Society (NTU/NIE MLCS), aims to instil the love of Malay Language and Culture amongst primary and secondary school students. The event was conducted virtually through Zoom on two afternoons.</p>
<p>Our students participated in various language activities such as completing Peribahasa cross word. They were also challenged to follow a simple Malay dance routine and to play &ldquo;Batu Seremban&rdquo;, also known as five stones. On top of these activities, our students put on their creative hats to write song lyrics spontaneously and do a collaborative batik painting. The event ended on a high note when they emerged as Champion for primary school category.</p>
<p>Fatin shared, &ldquo;I feel so proud of our achievement and I was very delighted that we were first place for two consecutive days!&rdquo; Wani has learnt more about batik from the activity and the short video shown. She also discovered a new way to make her batik painting neater. Even though the event was a virtual one, our students had an enjoyable time working together and applying their knowledge that they attained in class.</p>
