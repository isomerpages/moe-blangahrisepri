<p>STEM Club provides opportunities for students to work on engineering-related activities as well as robotics using Lego WeDo 2.0 and Lego SPIKE. The students work collaboratively to build robots and acquire programming skills. These activities develop students&rsquo; creativity, critical thinking, problem-solving and decision-making skills. It also builds their enthusiasm and stimulate their interest in STEM learning.</p>
<p>Students learn to build robots ranging from a simple car to complex machineries that can navigate through a maze. They use the engineering design process cycle to explore and try out new ideas. Students work together as a team to evaluate and improve upon their own designs, imbuing in them the virtues of resilience and collaboration. &ldquo;We work in teams to build different robots every week and code them to move. Together, we can do it!&rdquo; said Judith, a Primary 4 student excitedly.</p>
<p>Students participate in school and external competitions such as National Robotics Competitions, Amazing Flying Competition as well as National Flying Simulation Competition. Our Primary 5 student, Yuan Xiang said, &ldquo;We share our ideas to help one another improve our design. We strive to win and do our best for the competitions.&rdquo; Values such as resilience, respect, determination and self-discipline are displayed by our students.</p>
