<p>Get inspired through STEM! Our P5 students participated in the STEM Playground Challenge organised by Science Centre Singapore in Term 1. For this challenge, students were tasked to build bridges that could hold at least five books using satay sticks. Many students brainstormed on ideas to build the bridges right after the briefing as they were very excited about the activity. To better support students, Science teachers shared with students some common designs of bridges around the world as well as the structural elements behind them. Although students were provided time during recess across the week to complete it, some students chose to construct it at home with their family instead. “I really enjoyed working on the challenge with my parents!” Yuan Feng from 5 Topaz shared.
