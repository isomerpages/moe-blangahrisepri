The book is inspired by the significance of nature in Telok Blangah and the green spaces surrounding our school. Nestled in the southern region of Singapore, Telok Blangah, which translates to "Cooking Pot Bay" in English, is a unique and beautiful area with a rich history.

The undulating terrain, verdant foliage, and sparkling waters of the bay form a natural tapestry in which our school is set in. The green spaces in this area include Telok Blangah Hill Park, Mount Faber Park, Hort Park, Kent Ridge Park and Labrador Nature Reserve. These spaces form the Southern Ridges of Singapore. Interestingly, these green spaces, when marked on the map, resemble the shape of a bowl.

Weaving the ideas of a cooking pot and a bowl together, this book reminds us of the way we are learning, working, and living in harmony with nature.

We hope that this book will serve as a source of inspiration for all those who love nature and appreciate the beauty of our world.

**Clean-Up at SWCDC 2024 @ Westgate, The Courtyard**

On 28 January 2024, our student leaders had the opportunity to present on our collaborative project with the National University of Singapore. Together with their NUS facilitators, our student leaders, Ser Yen, Marvell and Kai Xiang shared about the school's collaboration with Minister Gan Kim Yong, Mayor Low Yen Ling and members of the public. In addition, they shared our publications - A Bowl of Nature and The Green Dragonflies and Their Swampy Friends, inviting Minister Gan and Mayor Low to sign a copy each. Ser Yen had an unforgettable experience when Minister Gan requested her autograph for her section in the book! Our student leaders were indeed honoured to be able to share their work at this event.
