<p>“I am overjoyed to achieve the bronze award for the Asia Pacific Mathematical Olympiad for Primary Schools (APMOPS). The time and effort that I put in for the Math Olympiad trainings and self-revision sessions were worth it. I will continue to do my best always!” shared Jonathan from Primary 6.</p>
<p>Jonathan Chan is a student who relentlessly pursues excellence and is hungry for knowledge. It was therefore no surprise when he obtained a Bronze award in the APMOPS. As a reserved boy, he overcomes his personal fears and displays the virtue of determination and perseverance in class. He never fails to participate actively in class discussions in order to make the best of his learning. This year, Jonathan represented our school in National Math competitions that include the River Valley Math Challenge 2021, Raffles Institution Primary Mathematics World Contest 2021 and APMOPS.</p>
<p>Competitions are not alien to Jonathan. As an active member of the STEM Club, Jonathan also represented our school in the National Robotics Competition and the Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competitions that were organised by the Singapore Science Centre. In order to achieve perfection in the making of his own aeroplane, he explored multiple ways and methods. Jonathan also proved himself as an excellent team player and leader as he worked together with his team members to explore, investigate and solve real-life problems.</p>
<p>Ms Ivy Teo shared, “It is a joy to have Jonathan in my class. Jonathan is self-motivated and perseveres always in all that he does. He is a good role-model for the class.’</p>
