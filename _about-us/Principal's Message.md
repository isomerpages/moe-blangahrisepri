Dear Visitors,

Welcome to Blangah Rise Primary School’s website! As the principal of this vibrant and forward-looking school, I am honored to share with you the exciting learning journey we embark on every day. Our school’s vision—"*A joyful school of confident learners and caring leaders*"—guides our mission to nurture well-rounded individuals ready to thrive in an ever-changing world.

Blangah Rise Primary School stands on a strong foundation of nurturing care and innovative practices, led by the dedicated efforts of my predecessor, Mr. Francis Foo. Together with our dedicated staff, I am committed to carrying forward this legacy by fostering a sense of belonging and creating opportunities for every student to feel supported, valued, and empowered.

We pride ourselves on preparing our students with 21st Century Competencies through meaningful and engaging learning experiences. Our programmes are designed to cultivate Active, Bold, Contributing, and Disciplined (ABCD) Learners who embody the following core values:

* Respect
* Integrity
* Self-discipline
* Empathy

At Blangah Rise Primary, we believe in the power of collaboration. The strong partnerships we have with our School Advisory Committee, Parent Support Group and key community partners play a vital role in shaping the holistic development of our students. Together, we aim to inspire confidence, creativity, and compassion in every child.

Thank you for visiting our website. We invite you to explore and learn more about the enriching opportunities and vibrant community at Blangah Rise Primary School. Together, let us continue to nurture every child’s potential and celebrate their successes.
