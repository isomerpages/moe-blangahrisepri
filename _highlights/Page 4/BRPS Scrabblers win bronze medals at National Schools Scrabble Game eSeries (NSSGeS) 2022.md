<p>After two years of Covid-19 restrictions to National Schools Games, the much-awaited Scrabble tournament was finally conducted on 27 and 28 April 2022. The tournament was played online via&nbsp;<a href="http://woogles.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://woogles.io&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1652921805815000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1FmMC2CHdDdLsbBi3E_wDs">woogles.io</a>&nbsp;platform, with as exacting standards as the Inter-School National Scrabble Championship (ISNSC). Cyber-wellness engagement was key, and the games&rsquo; proceedings were carried out with propriety and integrity in the presence of the school&rsquo;s Presiding Officer (PO), in this case, the Teacher in-charge of Scrabble. The format of categorization of the tournament was CUP (most competitive), PLATE (developmental/average) and BOWL (improving).</p>
<p>The majority of our players are greenhorns from Primary 3 and 4. Two players from Primary 5 participated in the Senior (S2) category on 27 April 2022. In total, 17 Primary 3 and 4 students took part in the Junior (J2) and Junior (J1) categories respectively on 28 April 2022. Despite the jitters from their first-ever exposure to a competitive environment, our young Scrabblers displayed true grit as they tried to outwit their invisible opponents on the other end of the virtual space.</p>
<p>The results were praiseworthy. Lea from 4 Topaz came in 4th position out of 18 participants to clinch the Bronze medal in the Junior (J1) PLATE category. Leo from 3 Opal also came in 4th position out of 12 participants to clinch the Bronze medal in the Junior (J2) CUP category. It was heartening to find that 4 of our P3 greenhorns were listed in the CUP category. This is definitely a good motivation for our P3 players to do better in more tournaments to come!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt so nervous. I need to think and act fast to beat my opponent. But the experience was good. I look forward to more Scrabble competitions.&rdquo; &ndash; Abigail from 3 Sapphire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The feeling was fantastic when you win a game. I learn from my mistakes when I lost.&rdquo; &ndash; Lionel from 5 Sapphire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe I achieved something in the Scrabble competition. I am so encouraged by this.&rdquo; - Lea from 4 Topaz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so excited. The feeling is fantastic. I want to encourage my teammates to continue giving their best in future Scrabble competitions.&rdquo; - Leo from 3 Opal.</p>
