This year, Blangah Rise Primary School supported SportsSG in their launch of GetActive! Singapore 2023: Senior Sports Day & Launch of Active X. 

Prior to the official launch, our dance club members were invited to take part in a pairing visit to the Lions Befrienders at Meiling Centre Active Ageing Centre(Inter-gen program) on 25 July. During the visit, our students got to bond with the seniors through games and dance. The girls learnt to play yesteryear kampung games from the seniors and in turn, the girls taught the seniors the 2023 Dance of the Nation workout. 

It was heartening to see the girls playing ball games with the seniors. Katie Yong of 4 Opal reflected, "It was fun playing with the uncles and aunties. We practised the virtues of care and teamwork. We took care of each other." Angie Kong of 3 Sapphire also shared, "This is my first time playing games with the seniors. It was fun and I really enjoyed it."  

  

It was evident from the smiles all around that everyone had an enjoyable time.
