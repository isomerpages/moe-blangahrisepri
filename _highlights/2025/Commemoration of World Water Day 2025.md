<p>This year, our school marked World Water Day with a meaningful week of
activities aimed at raising awareness about water conservation and the
importance of preserving glaciers.</p>

<p>The week of 24 to 28 March 2025 kicked off with an assembly led by our
Student Leaders, who highlighted the need to preserve glaciers to sustain
freshwater supplies. They also shared the role our students can play towards
conserving water in their daily lives.</p>
<p>During FTGP lessons, our students were engaged in activities to learn
more practical tips to save and conserve water both in school and at home.
At recess, they also took part in water-themed quizzes where learning was
reinforced in a fun and interactive way. A new initiative, <strong>Project DROP</strong>,
was introduced to encourage students and their families to track their
household water savings. This activity helped extend learning beyond the
classrooms and promoted water-wise habits in the wider community.</p>

<p>Adding to the highlights was a team of our students who represented the
school in an <strong>Infographic Design Competition </strong>organised by
Dunman High school. Our students showcased their creativity and advocated
water issues through visually impactful ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The entire week was campaigned as <strong>Bring-Your-Own-Bottle (BYOB)</strong> week
to encourage students and staff to reduce plastic waste and make conscious
choices about water consumption. On 25 March 2025 itself, all staff members
also donned blue attire to symbolise our shared commitment towards protecting
our water resources.</p>
<p>World Water Day 2025 was a significant reminder of how everyone can play
a part in building a more sustainable future of our water resources. Every
Drop Counts!</p>
<p>Let’s hear the thoughts shared by two of our Student Leaders:</p>
<p><strong>Kai Xiang, 6 Topaz</strong>
</p>
<p>“I think participating in Bring-Your-Own-Bottle Day is very meaningful.
It helps raise the awareness among students that the water we consume is
closely related to our actions in water conservation. For instance, if
we pollute the seawater but fail to make efforts to clean it, we will have
lesser clean water to use in the future. We must start doing something
about it to enjoy a bright water future.”</p>
<p><strong>Dave, 6 Topaz</strong>
</p>
<p>“Project DROP is a meaningful initiative that helps create a positive
impact on water saving. &nbsp;When I invite my friends to participate in
this project, I was able to share with them several ways on how they can
save water. Through this experience, I have learnt how to conserve water
and use water more responsibly.”</p>
