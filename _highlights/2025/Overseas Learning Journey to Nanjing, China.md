<p>To develop 21st century competencies, a group of 20 students and 5 teachers
went on a 4-day overseas learning journey to Nanjing, China. The students
were excited to finally meet their pen pals in person. Upon arrival, the
group received a warm welcome from the staff and students of East Beijing
Primary School. During their time there, they participated in a variety
of interactive activities and had many opportunities to connect with peers
from different cultural backgrounds.</p>
<p>Highlights of the visit included a storytelling session, hands-on Chinese
brush painting where they decorated handheld fans with peony designs, and
even some fun physical activities like rope skipping. “It was my first
time attempting to paint using a Chinese paintbrush. The teacher was very
patient and taught me the correct way of holding the brush. I felt a sense
of accomplishment when I was able to draw out a peony flower!” commented
Krystal from 5 Opal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since learning takes place out of the classrooms, students had the opportunity
to visit several renowned sites, including the Museum of Paleontology.
They learnt about prehistoric animals and even saw real dinosaur egg fossils.
They also explored an insect museum, where they deepened their understanding
of various insect life cycles and enjoyed close-up interactions with the
insects themselves.</p>

<p>To learn more about China's rich history, the students visited the Gate
of China, where they admired the centuries-old architectural masterpiece.
They also explored the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, where they gained insights
about the life and contributions of Sun Yat-sen — a renowned physician,
revolutionary leader, statesman, and political thinker who founded the
Republic of China. “This trip has broadened my horizons and given me the
opportunity to learn more about the Chinese history and got me interested
to find out more about the contributions of Dr Sun. I will now make use
of my free time in the weekend to read up more on the history of China.”

<p>This overseas learning journey not only strengthened our ties with our
partner school but also provided our students with rich, immersive experiences
that deepened their understanding of Chinese history and culture. It was
truly an enriching learning experience which would be etched in our students’
and teachers’ minds for a long time.</p>
