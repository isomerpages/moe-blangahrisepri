<p>Blangah Rise Primary School is excited to join the recycling movement
again! We are calling on all students, parents, and staff to recycle for
a greener planet. Bring your old but clean clothes, newspapers, magazines,
unwanted clean paper, and cartons to school. Let’s all do our part to help
the environment! ♻️</p>
<p>📅 From 17 October to 13 November 2024</p>
<p>📍 Place your bags of recyclables in the green bins located near the school’s
guardhouse, next to the main gate</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can pass the recyclables to your child or come in person to drop them
off yourself. Every little bit helps in reducing waste and caring for our
Earth! 🌍✨ Let’s make this year’s Clean Up South West a success together!</p>
