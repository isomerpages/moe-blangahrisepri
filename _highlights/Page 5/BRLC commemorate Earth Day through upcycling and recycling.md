<p>Unwanted CDs, bottle caps and cardboard boxes, what do all of these have in common? These were the materials used by our students in their upcycling activities.</p>
<p>On 19 April 2022, Blangah Rise Learning Campus commemorated Earth Day with the Primary School and MOE Kindergarten arms coming together through different activities.</p>
<p>At the primary school, the main focus was on upcycling and reusing unwanted materials. All three schools were engaged in in activities to further the message of sustainability. In our junior primary classes, students decorated the recycling boxes used in their classes. Our middle primary students used bottle caps to create a piece of art while our senior primary students upcycled used CDs into a card with a message of sustainability. These upcycling projects are part of our ongoing efforts to commemorate Earth Day 2022 and to teach our students how we can reduce waste through upcycling.</p>

<p>At the MOE Kindergarten, pre-schoolers watched a video that showed the impact of the rise in sea levels around Singapore. &nbsp;Our pre-schoolers expressed concerns that Singapore may be flooded and that they would not be able to live in their homes like before. They also learned about the rising temperature that would make daily living uncomfortable.</p>
<p>So how can we play our part to “save” the earth? Our MK teachers imparted the mantra “save electricity and recycle whenever possible.” Our students gained the understanding of how to recycle right. They learned about the “Bloobin” that is placed in our school and housing estates for recycled items. Ms Candice from K2 Courage told her students, that items had to be washed clean before being placed in the Bloobin recycling bins. Her students were excited to visit the Bloobin placed in school and were made aware of the different types of items that could be placed inside the bin. The students also participated in an activity to identify items that could or could not be placed inside. They were unanimous in saying “Yes” or “No” to the teacher’s questions like “Can you place newspaper inside Bloobin?”, “Can you throw used tissue inside Bloobin?”.</p>

<p>Our K1 students had a fun time matching the different identical Bloobins and learned that their plastic bottles should be rinsed before they can be recycled. Ms Pauline teacher of K1 Love explained to her students that dirty items cannot be recycled and would contaminate the other items in the bin. When the children were told about the effects of deforestation, Sannaya said “We must protect the tress so that animals have a home.”</p>
<p>In K2 Integrity, the students were engaged in their “Week of Wonder” topic on recycling. Earth Day added on to their findings that saving the trees and using less paper is important to help to save the Earth. The students learned that instead of wood from trees, bamboo can also be used also in the making of furniture and even fabric. Bamboo trees also cool the surrounding environment and reduce the negative effects of global warming.</p>
<p>All in all, the focus on upcycling and recycling activities served as a reminder to our younger generation that they must always strive to protect the environment and live a more sustainable life.</p>
