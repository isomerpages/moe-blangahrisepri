This year, our students participated in the Annual Mathlympics for All Primary Schools 2023. It is a school-based competition organised by Learnersâ€™ Connections Pte Ltd. This competition requires students to think critically and apply mathematical concepts to solve challenging problems. We would like to send our heartiest congratulations to Muthurasu Thanushraj (4 Opal) and Chu Zhongteng Kayden (5 Sapphire) for attaining the Merit and Bronze Certifications respectively in the competition.  Well Done, Thanushrai and Kayden!
