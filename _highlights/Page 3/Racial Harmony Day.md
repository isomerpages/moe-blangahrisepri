<p>&ldquo;I did not know that my classmates and I have so much in common!&rdquo; exclaimed Jayden, a Primary 3 student.</p>
<p>As part of our Racial Harmony Day celebrations, our Primary 3 and 4 students took part in the &ldquo;Hexagonal Harmony&rdquo; activity where they put their artistic talents into practice by drawing a picture of themselves and their favourite things on a hexagonal-shaped template. These pictures were combined into a tapestry that showcases how each and every student can come together to form a beautiful mosaic. This year, we celebrated Racial Harmony Day on 19 July with the theme &ldquo;Our Multicultural Mosaic&rdquo;. Just like how a beautiful picture can be formed from each individual mosaic piece coming together, we too can come together in harmony by working hand-in-hand with each other.</p>
<p>Our junior primary students learnt about various cultural festivals in Singapore and also &ldquo;Singapore&rsquo;s Favourite Breakfasts&rdquo;. Although we are all different in our own way, food is a common thread that binds us all as Singaporeans. We all celebrate our local festivals together and we all love our delicious local food! The students also learned to be proactive in finding out more about each other&rsquo;s cultures. As our junior primary students gain knowledge, they also learn to respect and enjoy the cultural differences.</p>
<p>Other than the hexagonal harmony activity, our middle primary students also learnt how to build and strengthen friendships by learning how to communicate respectively. &ldquo;I realised that we need to place ourselves in the shoes of others and try to understand each other,&rdquo; shared Ken from Primary 4.</p>
<p>Our senior primary students worked in groups to respond to different scenarios through role play.&nbsp;They learnt to muster courage to speak up and stand up against bad behaviours.&nbsp;Through discussion, students learnt how to respond respectfully and strengthen harmony in the community. When&nbsp;we think win-win, we always have an abundance mentality and there will always be enough for everyone; be it the common spaces we have or the emotional bank account of others.</p>
<p>In Singapore, we cannot take our harmony for granted. All these activities help to build understanding and strengthen friendships. It is important for us to have respectful and empathetic conversations with each other. Every year, Racial Harmony Day reminds us to put aside our differences and embrace each other as Singaporeans and celebrate our unity, diversity and multicultural mosaic. </p>
