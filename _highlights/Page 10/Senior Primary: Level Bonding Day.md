<p>This year, our Level Bonding Day takes place very differently from previous years. With COVID 19, many activities have to be carried out innovatively to achieve their objectives. However, this does not deter us from having fun together! With the safety management measures in place, all of us had fun together even when we are 1 m apart!</p>
