<p>This week, our Primary 6 students will be sitting for their Primary School
Leaving Examinations (PSLE). They have been working hard to prepare themselves
for it. To boost their spirits and rally them to put in their best efforts,
the prefects had curated a special Care Pack for all P6 students. This
initiative is also an important reminder for our P6 students that they
have the full support of the entire school community.</p>
<p>Each item in the Care Pack had been thoughtfully selected to provide encouragement
and practical assistance. From exam essentials to little treats, every
component of the pack is meant to uplift and inspire confidence during
this crucial period.</p>

<p>The items were packed and presented by our prefects, who put their heart
into ensuring that each P6 student feels motivated and supported. Their
efforts highlight the keen sense of camaraderie within our school, where
everyone plays a role in supporting one another.</p>
<p>To our P6 students, we wish you the best of luck in your exams. You can
do it!</p>
