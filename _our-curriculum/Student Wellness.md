<p>The holistic well-being of our students is important to us. There are
four guiding principles that shape our commitment to student well-being:</p>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Principle 1: Total Wellness</strong>
</p>
<p><em>Nurturing a Healthy Body and a Curious Mind</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2024 Photos/Student Wellness/image003.jpg">
</div>
<p>Encouraging an active lifestyle is important in building physical well-being.
Our students are encouraged to prioritise regular exercise, enough rest,
and a balanced diet. We encourage our students to be curious and pursue
an area of interest or find their passion. We create opportunities through
House practice to learn a new sport and new skills.</p>
<p>Hannah from Primary 4 shared about her House Practice experience. "Joining
the House Practice sessions makes me feel strong and happy! When I play
and exercise, I feel better and can pay more attention in class."</p>
<p>Therefore, engaging in physical activities boosts overall fitness and
helps our students be more attentive and participative in class.</p>
<p><em>Fostering Intellectual Strengths</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 80%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2024 Photos/Student Wellness/SW_1.png">
</div>
<p>We believe in nurturing bold learnersâ€”students are not afraid to dive
deep into exploration and questioning. We believe it is important to foster
a growth mindset, where setbacks are viewed as stepping stones for personal
growth.</p>
<p>We design our learning experiences to make students curious and help them
think on their own. We encourage them to be brave in their learning, exploring
new ideas without fear. This way, they become better at handling challenges
and adapting to changes in the world.</p>
<p><em>Building Social Connections</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2024 Photos/Student Wellness/image011.jpg">
</div>
<p>We firmly believe in the power of nurturing strong social connections
among our students. We understand that fostering these bonds is essential
for their overall development and success. By encouraging collaboration
and teamwork, we instill in them the value of working together towards
common goals. Through these interactions, students learn to appreciate
diversity and respect differing viewpoints, essential skills for their
future endeavors. Additionally, these social connections provide them with
a support system, contributing to their emotional well-being and resilience.
We design our learning environment to facilitate these connections, creating
opportunities for students to engage with one another, build friendships,
and grow together. Just as we cultivate a growth mindset in academics,
we also strive to cultivate a culture of connection and camaraderie, where
every student feels valued and supported in their educational journey.</p>
<p><em>Developing Inner Resilience</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2024 Photos/Student Wellness/image009.jpg">
</div>
<p>We want to nurture students to be strong and focused, even when things
get tough. We believe this comes from taking care of our emotions and staying
mindful. We engage in activities such as mindfulness exercises and self-reflection
to foster this strength, alongside supporting others in their journey.
Overall, we want our students to do well in school and become a disciplined
learner, that is one who is able to balance his physical, mental, social
and emotional well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Principle 2: Every Student Matters</strong>
</p>
<p><em>Empowering Students</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>We highly value the voices of our students and thus actively encourage
them to share their thoughts and ideas. One key opportunity we create for
our students is the Class-based monthly Student Wellness Day. We invite
students to contribute their suggestions for activities for this day. By
doing so, we ensure that the activities reflect their interests and promotes
total wellness effectively. Additionally, in-house practices and inter-house
games offer another avenue for student voices to be heard. By allowing
students to form their own teams, they learn to make decisions, fostering
autonomy and empowerment. Furthermore, during the daily pre-assembly Heart-to-Heart
Conversations, teachers make a deliberate effort to reach out to individual
students, seeking to understand more about their needs. This personalised
approach underscores our dedication to supporting each student's academic
and personal development journey, ensuring that they feel heard, valued,
and supported in their endeavours.</p>
<p>Viewpoints (Link to the page), a tiered modular programme, plays a crucial
role in encouraging the student voice within the school community. These
programmes provide dedicated platforms for students to share their perspectives,
opinions, and experiences with their peers through print, photo and broadcast
journalism as well as public speaking. Through these programs, students
not only express themselves but also learn to listen to and respect the
viewpoints of their peers, contributing to a more inclusive and vibrant
school environment.</p>
<p><em>Forging friendships</em>
</p>
<p>We create opportunities for students to form meaningful relationships
with both their peers and teachers. The monthly Student Wellness Day is
eagerly anticipated by all students! These wellness experiences not only
encourage positive contributions to the class community but also foster
a sense of connection and appreciation for the world around them. The experiences
are design also to provide opportunities for our students to practice the
7-habits and virtues they have learnt.</p>

<p>As shared by Ms. Maddie Wong, during the morning exploration of the Garden
of Hope, students engaged in relaxing walks while not only sharing their
observations of plants and animals but also offering each other support
and assistance along the way. These immersive experiences serve to not
only promote well-being but also cultivate close bonds and long-lasting
friendships among students.</p>

<p>As Alicia from Primary 2 beautifully expressed, "The Fukkuwarai game which
we played during Student Wellness Day was fun! I learnt teamwork and active
listening from the activity." Such firsthand experiences highlight the
effectiveness of interactive and engaging activities in fostering not only
academic growth but a lasting sense of camaraderie among students, enriching
their school experience and fostering a supportive community spirit.</p>
<p><em>Level Ambassadors: Advocates for Student Wellness</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 80%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2024 Photos/Student Wellness/SW_2.png">
</div>
<p>Our Level Ambassadors are more than just student leaders; they are dedicated
advocates for student wellness. Equipped with empathy, trustworthiness,
and patience, they undergo comprehensive training, both online and face-to-face,
to fully understand their roles. These ambassadors play a vital part in
fostering a sense of belonging and inclusivity within our school community,
welcoming new students, befriending those who may feel excluded, and promoting
a culture of care in every classroom and peer group.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 80%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2024 Photos/Student Wellness/SW_3.png">
</div>
<p></p>
<p>Our Level Ambassadors actively help teachers in planning and conducting
Student Wellness Day activities, garnering ideas from their classmates
to ensure relevance and engagement. They take charge of conducting assembly
talks, imparting practical handles to students on various topics such as
cyber wellness and emotional well-being during exam periods. Additionally,
they work with teachers to organize recess activities aimed at promoting
wellness among students, such as cyber wellness pledge card writing, and
activities that promote emotional and mental well-being. Through their
dedication and proactive initiatives, our Level Ambassadors contribute
significantly to creating a safe, inclusive, and supportive learning environment
where every student can thrive.</p>
<p><strong>Principle 3: Every Teacher a Mentor - Guiding, Supporting, and Celebrating Success</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Teacher Mentoring Programme supports our efforts to promote the holistic
well-being of our students. Every teacher is a mentor, guiding students
through their personal growth journey. Our teachers wear multiple hats
at our school, serving as coaches, counselors, and cheerleaders for our
students.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 80%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2024 Photos/Student Wellness/SW_4.png">
</div>
<p><strong>Coach:</strong> Our teachers act as coaches, guiding students through
their learning journey. With a focus on support and guidance, they help
students by providing encouragement and resources.</p>
<p><strong>Counselor:</strong> Recognizing the importance of emotional well-being,
our teachers also serve as counselors. They create a safe space for personal
discussions where students can share their challenges and joys. By actively
listening, they help students build emotional resilience and grow.</p>
<p><strong>Cheerleader:</strong> Celebrating success is a big part of our
culture. Our teachers act as cheerleaders, celebrating achievements and
reinforcing positive behavior. By celebrating both big and small milestones,
we help build students' confidence and create a positive environment for
learning.</p>
<p><em>Teacher Mentors (TM) in action</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 60%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2024 Photos/Student Wellness/image018.jpg">
</div>
<p>One of the many opportunities for teachers to mentor students is the daily
Teacher-Student Relationship (TSR) time which helps our students start
the day right. The time is dedicated to short activities that build bonds,
small group mentoring, and Heart-to-Heart Talks, where form teachers connect
with students through open and meaningful conversations. These interactions
create connections that last beyond the classroom.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 80%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2024 Photos/Student Wellness/SW_5.png">
</div>
<p>Additionally, our students also look forward to group mentoring sessions
led by CCA teachers. These sessions not only provide personalized guidance
but also create an enjoyable atmosphere for students to connect with their
peers and mentors. These sessions offer a supportive space for students
to discuss challenges, set goals, and receive valuable advice on both academic
and personal development. Our TM guide students in pursuing their passion
projects and guide those interested in DSA. By combining mentorship with
fun bonding activities, we foster a vibrant community where students feel
supported, empowered, and connected to their peers and mentors.</p>
<p><strong>Principle 4: Working Together</strong>
</p>

</div>
<p>The school works in partnership with our parents and the community to
support our students.</p>
<p>Our teachers connect and work with parents to ensure every child feels
seen, heard, and supported. Teachers tap on various class communication
platforms to keep our students informed about their progress and successes.</p>
<p>Our parents volunteer their time and effort to support school activities.
This includes festive and commemorative events as well as recess art and
science activities.</p>
<p>Our community partners include A* Agency, Junior Achievement Singapore
and Telok Blangah Community Club who support our teachers in various student
programmes. We also have established partnerships with secondary schools
and higher institutions to mentor and motivate our students during <a href="https://www.blangahrisepri.moe.edu.sg/departments/ccas/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CCA</a> as
well as support our talent development efforts.</p>

<p>In our Blangahnite Family, every student matters, and every success is
shared. Our parents and community partners share our belief that each child
is like a treasure chest full of talents just waiting to be discovered.
We make it a point to acknowledge and celebrate the individual strengths
and talents of each student in our vibrant community. Whether it is a gift
for creativity, a love for science, or a talent in sports, we take the
time to uncover and honor the unique qualities that make each student stand
out. With our hearts and hands joined, we ensure each child reaches their
full potential and shines brightly.</p>
