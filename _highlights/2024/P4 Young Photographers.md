<h4>P4 Young Photographers</h4>
<p>On 4 July, our Primary 4 students embarked on an exciting learning journey
and outdoor shoot to Gardens by the Bay as part of their Young Photographers
programme. The students were able to apply their classroom learning to
real-world scenarios, capturing the beauty of their surroundings through
the lens of a camera. They also had the opportunity to apply concepts gleaned
during Science lessons to an authentic context.</p>

<p>The P4 students they handled DSLR cameras for the first time under the
guidance of professional instructors. The day was filled with both learning
and adventure, as students explored the world of photography in the stunning
settings of the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest.</p>

<p>At the Flower Dome, students were mesmerised by the vibrant array of flowers,
each differing in shapes, colours, and sizes. They skillfully captured
these details, applying various photography techniques learned in class.
The Cloud Forest presented a different challenge, with its misty atmosphere
and lush greenery.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the learning journey and outdoor shoot, Carys from 4 Opal
found the experience enjoyable, appreciating the time spent with friends
and teachers while practising her photography skills. "I loved being able
to use the composition techniques we had learnt in class.‚Äù</p>

<p>Similarly, Fuadah from 4 Sapphire successfully applied the Rule of Thirds
when taking her photographs, capturing the vibrant flowers. Both students
expressed a keen interest in participating in similar activities in the
future, eager to explore more locations and further hone their photography
skills.</p>
<p>The Young Photographers programme not only allowed students to discover
the art of photography but also fostered a deeper appreciation for the
natural beauty around them. It was a day of creativity, learning, and memorable
experiences where rich learning took place beyond the classrooms, and that
the P4 students would cherish for a long time.</p>
