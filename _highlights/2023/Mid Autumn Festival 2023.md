You’d know when Mid-Autumn Festival is around the corner thanks to our artistic and passionate parents from Parents Support Group (PSG)! They beautifully decorated the whiteboard and LEGO board outside our General Office with lanterns adorning the walkway to school.

In class, our students and teachers also had a good time working on their masterpieces to celebrate this traditional festival. During FTGP, our Primary One to Three students got their hands busy drawing and designing different mooncakes on paper plates. Our Primary Four to Six students creatively transformed recycled plastic bottles into beautiful lanterns. 

After the classroom activities, our student emcees, Lien Heidi Zhao Hui (4 Topaz) and Marvell Nathaniel Tjong (4 Opal) led the school through a concert celebration in the school hall. Have you heard of the legend of Chang’e and Hou Yi and do you know how Mid-Autumn Festival came about? Through a video presentation, we learnt about it as Heidi and Marvell shared the significance of the festival with the school! As part of the concert, our talented kindergarten students presented an enchanting dance performance and our Chinese BRPS Idols sang to the melodious tune of a Mid-Autumn song. We were also delighted to have our friends from Tanglin Trust School to join us in the celebration.
Phua Ser Yen (5 Topaz) shared, “The celebration was so fun and I enjoyed the lantern making segment the most. I was able to use the recycled bottles to create the lantern and draw Mid-Autumn related images on it!” 

We would like to wish all our friends a Happy Mid-Autumn Festival!
