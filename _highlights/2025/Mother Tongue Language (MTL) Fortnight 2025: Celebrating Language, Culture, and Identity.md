<p>The beauty of our Mother Tongue Languages and the rich cultural heritage
they embody came alive during MTL Fortnight 2025! Held from 8 to 18 July,
this school-wide programme provided students from Primary 1 to 6 with authentic,
hands-on experiences that deepened their appreciation of their Mother Tongue
Language while developing important communication and cultural literacy
skills.</p>
<p>Through a variety of engaging cultural and language-based activities,
students explored the relevance of their language in daily life, honed
their oral communication skills, and experienced the joy of expressing
themselves creatively in their respective Mother Tongue Language. The activities
were designed to spark curiosity, promote cultural understanding, and provide
authentic contexts for the use of language.</p>
