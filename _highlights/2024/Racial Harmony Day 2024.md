<p>We commemorated Racial Harmony Day with the theme “Singapore, Multicultural
Mosaic,” emphasising the rich diversity and unity within our community.
The festivities kicked off with an engaging morning assembly hosted by
Lam Khai from 4 Topaz and Illiyin from 5 Topaz, featuring a vibrant display
of multicultural performances and mass dances.</p>
<p>A highlight of the day was the cross-cultural dance performed by Primary
2 students. The item showcased traditional Chinese, Indian, and Malay dances.
Each group of students performed a dance from another culture. This illustrated
the beauty of cultural diversity and mutual respect among students.</p>
<p>During recess, the school buzzed with traditional cultural games such
as chapteh, five stones, congkak, and carrom. The mini library was adorned
with a display of ethnic costumes, providing students a deeper appreciation
of various cultures. A special menu featuring Nasi Lemak was also available,
adding a flavourful touch to the celebration.</p>
<p>In the classroom, activities varied by age group during the Form Teacher
Guidance Period (FTGP). Junior Primary students used air clay to create
models of traditional foods from different ethnic groups, enhancing their
creativity and cultural understanding. Middle Primary students designed
ethnic wear, contributing to a multicultural mosaic that celebrated the
cultural tapestry within the school. Meanwhile, Senior Primary students
developed a cultural board game, promoting further cultural understanding
and appreciation among their peers.</p>
<p>The day's activities not only educated the students about different traditions
but also fostered a spirit of unity and harmony. By participating in these
events, the school community embodied the true essence of Racial Harmony
Day, underscoring the importance of embracing and celebrating the diverse
cultures that enrich our lives.</p>
