This year, Blangah Rise Primary and First Toa Payoh Primary came together as a combined football team to participate in National School Games (NSG) 2023.

While the student-athletes may come from different schools and diverse backgrounds, they played as a team with the mantra of 'never give up.' In 3 of 4 of the South Zone group stage matches, the team came from behind (trailing 2 goals in each of the 3 matches) to win the matches. Overall, the combined team won all 4 matches and emerged as winners of the group stage. They are now preparing and looking forward to the quarter finals. Go Team!
