<p>The Primary Two Learning Journey to Sentosa was both fun and educational.
Students participated in the Marine ConservAction programme, where they
learnt about the importance of protecting the marine environment. Through
interactive activities, they discovered ways to reduce pollution and conserve
marine life, fostering a deeper understanding of environmental responsibility.
Another highlight was the visit to Co-Nut-Ink, where students learned about
sustainability by reusing coconut husks. They explored creative ways to
repurpose natural materials, gaining insights into waste reduction and
eco-friendly practices. This enriching experience instilled valuable lessons
on environmental conservation and sustainable living in a hands-on, memorable
way.</p>
