<p>Our Primary 5 students had an enriching learning experience at the National
Education (NE) Show, themed "Together, As One United People." They enjoyed
watching the parade, singing along, and viewing the spectacular fireworks.</p>
<p>Abigail from 5 Sapphire shared her excitement, saying, "It would either
be the fighter jets zooming above us or the marching parade showcasing
the emergency vehicles. It was nice to see them personally!"</p>
<p>Batrisyia, also from 5 Sapphire, was captivated by the cultural elements,
"I enjoyed the music, dancing, and learning about our country in the NE
Show. I loved watching the performances that showcased our country's history,
culture, and core values. The performances reminded us about how much we
had achieved as a nation."</p>
<p>Mahisha from 5 Topaz found the Red Lions Parachute display particularly
thrilling, "I enjoyed the Red Lions Parachute display as it was exciting
to watch. The Red Lions were really awesome during their landing at the
Padang. I also enjoyed the performances as well as the fireworks display."</p>
<p>Vivian from 5 Topaz expressed her delight with the musical performances,
highlighting the NDP 2024 Theme song, "The theme song 'Not Alone' performance
by Benjamin Kheng was fantastic. I also enjoyed participating in the Padang
wave."</p>
<p>Our students left the show with a deeper appreciation for our nation's
history and a sense of pride in our shared future.</p>
