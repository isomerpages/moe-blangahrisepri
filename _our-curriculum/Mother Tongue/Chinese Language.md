<p></p><p><strong>Description of Programmes:<br></strong><strong><em>Blended Learning for All</em></strong></p>
<p>Learning of the Chinese Language does not take place only in the classroom. Online lessons and e-learning tasks are planned for our students so that they can continue to learn the language at their own pace at home. Students can complete assignments set by their Chinese teachers through the&nbsp;<strong>Student Learning Space (SLS)</strong>. With the various functions of SLS, students can view videos uploaded by their teacher, complete online homework, and even upload presentation videos of their own.</p>
<p>In class, our students also get to use iPads for interactive activities to support their learning. Students can use these activities, such as educational games on Nearpod, to assess their own learning. Teachers can also provide immediate and individualised feedback after the students have completed the activities.</p>

<p><strong><em>Inquiry-based Learning<br></em></strong>“May I conduct an interview with you? I would like to find out what you do and learn in your CCA.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>During our Inquiry-based Learning (IBL) week, we can often hear our students busy interviewing their peers or conducting surveys as they work on different IBL tasks assigned to them. Through Inquiry-based Learning (IBL), our students engage in self-directed and collaborative learning. IBL, paired with authentic learning, promotes critical and inventive thinking skills in our students as they attempt to solve real-world problems. For instance, students apply the sentence structures they learnt in their Chinese Language lessons and present them confidently to their peers.</p>

</p><p><strong><em>Chinese Language Fortnight<br></em></strong>Every year, the Chinese Fortnight will be conducted for Chinese Language students. It is an important platform for experiential learning of the Chinese Language. Students get to experience and appreciate the Chinese Language and the Chinese culture through engaging cultural activities, such as traditional handicraft making, language-related games (think&nbsp;idioms and riddles!) and even performing arts (drama).</p>

<p><strong><em>Mother Tongue (Chinese) Camps<br></em></strong>Have you painted a traditional Chinese fan before? What about Chinese Calligraphy?&nbsp;How about painting a traditional Chinese fan? All these cultural activities keep our students busy during our Chinese Language camps. The annual camp deepens our students’ understanding of the Chinese culture and its traditions and encourages the use of the Chinese Language. An engaging environment is created for our P4 and P6 students to learn and use the Chinese Language frequently and in an authentic setting. During the camps, students are exposed to various learning experiences that will involve the Chinese Language and culture.</p>

<p><strong><em>School Internal Competitions<br></em></strong>Learning takes place when students are able to apply what they had learnt in their classrooms. As such, internal language competitions are organised for our students every semester. These internal competitions varied from speaking to writing, and students get to pit their creativity and knowledge against each other.</p>

<p><strong><em>National Competitions<br></em></strong>Students are also given opportunities to represent the school in various national competitions. The variety of competitions available allows students of all abilities to have a chance to shine on the national stage. Students get to practice the virtues of confidence and courage when they face off with students from other schools.</p>

<p><strong><em>Customised Programmes for Different Language Abilities<br></em></strong><strong><em>Primary Three and Primary Four Higher Chinese Language&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p>Higher Mother Tongue Language (HMTL) is offered at P5 and P6 to students who demonstrate strong proficiency and interest in their Mother Tongue Language (MTL). In 2022, to further strengthen the learning of MTL from an early age, we offered Higher Chinese Language (HCL) at P3.&nbsp;The curriculum is designed to enthuse P3 students who demonstrate the ability and interest to develop higher levels of MTL language proficiency and cultural knowledge.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Customised Programmes for Different Language Abilities<br></em></strong><strong><em>Mother Tongue Support Programme (MTSP)</em></strong></p>
<p>If you walk pass the MTSP classroom, you will often hear our students exclaim“我真棒！” excitedly, whenever they manage to form their Chinese sentences correctly and receive encouragement from their teacher and peers. We recognise that every child learns languages differently. Therefore we are on board the MOE Mother Tongue Support Programme (MTSP) to support our Primary 3 and Primary 4 students in the learning of the Chinese Language. Students in this programme receive differentiated instruction in class, which caters to their learning needs. There are various engaging and meaningful activities as well as resources to support and encourage our students in the learning of the Chinese Language.</p>
