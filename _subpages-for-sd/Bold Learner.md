Trees remind us to grow regardless of intense difficulties, roughest weather, hardest places and heartless circumstances. Trees are exposed to elements that break their branches, hurt their roots and take their leaves. But they stand still and strong, showing us that it is possible to grow stronger, and fight against the elements and win. To support every Blangahnite in their growth, our teachers are always there to provide mentorship and companioning.&nbsp; To foster trusting relationships between teachers and students, form teachers meet up with students every morning to speak the language of virtues and also to connect with them. Through these discussions, teachers get to know more about the student’s life, experiences and goals. Renard, a Primary 6 student shares, “I look forward to TSR Time as I get time to share with my Form Teachers my views and opinions on class matters.” Mdm Sa’adah adds, “TSR Time gives me opportunities to get to know my students in my form class better.”

In our House System introduced in 2021, we learn and grow together as a community. Teachers connect with students and provide guidance to them. House members are engaged in games and rapport is built upon a climate of trust, care and respect. To support the students academically, Teacher Mentors guide the students in Self-Study for up to an hour before the physical activities.

‘GOTCHA! Caught you doing good!’ is a platform for recognising students who exhibit the Seven Habits and the underlying virtues by doing good deeds. Students are caught doing these deeds in their everyday actions and routines by their teacher mentors. We also recognize students that demonstrate grit and resilience during CCAs and House Practice. The acts are then featured and shared with the rest of the student population, encouraging them preserve in the face of difficult circumstances.

In Blangah Rise, we nurture our students to be reflective learners who keep growing. They bravely forge forward and choose their own path. Our teacher mentors teach our students to make sound decisions. In our education career guidance, we help the students explore their interests/strengths and to develop a growth mindset. Our students have the courage to walk their own path, to boldly go where others have not gone before.

Through online conferencing, students are able to hear inspirational stories from how others have built on their strengths to overcome challenges in their lives to find their calling. Julia, from Primary 6, excitedly shared that: “A barista showed us how to brew coffee online and it was cool!. I also found out about some of the challenges in working in the service industry.”

The school also has a programme starting with simple introductory FTGP lessons on Career Guidance for Middle Primary students to in-depth FTGP lessons and the introduction of the MySkillsFuture portal for Senior Primary students. MySkillsFuture is a one-stop ECG portal that empowers students to embark on a journey of self-discovery and make informed education and career choices. We believe that our students are bold enough to listen to their hearts, and courageous enough to forge the path they want for themselves.
