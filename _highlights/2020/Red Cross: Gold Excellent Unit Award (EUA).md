<p>We would like to congratulate our Red Cross Links for achieving the Gold Excellent Unit Award for the year 2019! For the excellence that our links have displayed, our unit has once again achieved this award for the twelfth consecutive year since 2009.</p>
<p>As a Uniformed Group, Red Cross brings together a team of passionate individuals committed to serving the school and the community for the greater good. We instill the values of self-discipline, order and teamwork to our links. Our links were engaged in a series of activities which created opportunities for our students to acquire lifesaving skills and habits, be socially responsible citizens and display a sense of global citizenship. Through these activities, our links develop into leaders who promote the humanitarian values of the Red Cross!</p>
