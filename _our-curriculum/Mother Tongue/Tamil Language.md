Cultural camps provide students with more opportunities to speak and learn their Mother Tongue Language in an authentic setting that is rich in the culture. These activities help students to appreciate their roots and learn the rationale and value in the various customary practices.

During this camp, I got to know more about the heritage of Tamilians.

The Primary 3 and 4 students went for a learning journey to the Indian Heritage Centre. They understood how the different cultures have shaped Singapore’s multi-cultural heritage and they also recognised the contributions made by the Indian community in the development of Singapore.

Inquiry Based Learning (IBL) engaged our students in self-directed and collaborative learning. With the authentic learning experience, IBL also promotes critical and inventive thinking skills in our students to solve real-world problems. In Tamil Language lessons, students carry out Inquiry-Based Learning in Tamil on a given topic. 

They gather information and data based on the topic, and discuss with their peers to gain a better understanding. Teachers, as facilitators, provide the platform and guidance for students support them in their learning process. 

Through this learning, I understood very well that we must keep our country clean. I also learnt more about how to navigate around the relevant websites to enhance my learning – Rishi, Primary 4.
