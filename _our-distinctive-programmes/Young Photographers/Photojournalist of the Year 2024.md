<p>I used the compostion techniques of Rule of Thirds and Layering to capture
my photographs. My photographs inspire me to dream big, even if we are
small. Rain or shine, big or small, pursuing our dreams always requires
courage, perseverance and determination. As a student, I will seize the
opportunity to take my first step, just like the small plant. Although
I am small, I have the chance to grow, just like the plant. Every step
I take requires time and effort. Though I do not have a clear dream yet,
I can start small and dream big.</p>
