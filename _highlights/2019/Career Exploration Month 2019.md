<p style="text-align: center;"><em>What are my strengths and interests?</em><br><em>What would I like to be when you grow up?</em><br><em>What habits and attitudes do I need to develop to help me achieve my future goals?</em></p>
<p>During our Career Exploration Month in May 2019, our primary school and MOE Kindergarten children were exposed to different careers. They had opportunities to interact with professionals from various fields and learn more about future career options.</p>
<p>Singapore Police Force and SBS Transit gave assembly talks and set up recess booths to help our children learn about the different careers available in their organizations.</p>
<p>Our school alumni lent their strong support! Dr Chai Siang Chew, a cardiologist, Ms Ashley Woo, an entrepreneur who develops board games, and Ms Gokki and Ms Punitha, a pair of sisters who have set up their own audit firm, gave a talk to our Primary 3 to 6 students and engaged our children in hands-on activities.</p>
<p>They were joined by Dr Ho Shen Yong, Associate Dean (Academic) of the College of Science from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. He thrilled our students with their 3D printer and telescope. Mr Saravanan, Programme Coordinator of Conservation International Asia-Pacific, shared on the role of an environmental educator and how students can become conservation scientists. Our parent volunteer, Ms Veronica, shared her experiences as a nurse at the National Cancer Centre and brought in equipment that nurses use in their everyday work.</p>
<p>Also, for the first time, the children had a chance to interact with Chef Mark and Dietician Wei Jie, members of the SATS team who have been preparing tasty and nutritious meals for them!</p>
<p>Senior primary students were also introduced to MySkillsFuture portal. This is a one-stop Educational and Career Guidance portal that empowers students to embark on a journey of self-discovery and make informed education and career choices. Students may use the information and tools to explore various education and career pathways, and take charge of their future. Parents may navigate the portal with their child using their child's account and take the opportunity to begin a conversation with them. MySkillsFuture portal can be assessed through&nbsp;<a href="http://www.myskillsfuture.sg/primary">www.myskillsfuture.sg/primary</a>.</p>
