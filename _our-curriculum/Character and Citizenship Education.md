Trees remind us to grow regardless of intense difficulties, roughest weather, hardest places and heartless circumstances. Trees are exposed to elements that break their branches, hurt their roots and take their leaves. But they stand still and strong, showing us that it is possible to grow stronger, and fight against the elements and win. To support every Blangahnite in their growth, our teachers are always there to provide mentorship and companioning.  

**Speaking the Language of Virtues**

In our daily interactions, we prioritize building trusting relationships between teachers and students. Our form teachers engage in morning meetings to instill the language of virtues, fostering an environment where students feel comfortable sharing their thoughts, experiences, and aspirations. Renard, a Primary 6 student, values these connections, stating, "I look forward to TSR Time as I get time to share with my Form Teachers my views and opinions on class matters." Mdm Sa’adah adds, “TSR Time gives me opportunities to get to know my students in my form class better.” By discussing virtues, teachers create a shared vocabulary that helps students understand and internalize important values. This language of virtues forms the foundation for positive character development and ethical decision-making.
