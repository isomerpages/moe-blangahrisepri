Trees remind us to grow regardless of intense difficulties, roughest weather, hardest places and heartless circumstances. Trees are exposed to elements that break their branches, hurt their roots and take their leaves. But they stand still and strong, showing us that it is possible to grow stronger, and fight against the elements and win. To support every Blangahnite in their growth, our teachers are always there to provide mentorship and companioning.  

**Speaking the Language of Virtues**

In our daily interactions, we prioritize building trusting relationships between teachers and students. Our form teachers engage in morning meetings to instill the language of virtues, fostering an environment where students feel comfortable sharing their thoughts, experiences, and aspirations. Renard, a Primary 6 student, values these connections, stating, "I look forward to TSR Time as I get time to share with my Form Teachers my views and opinions on class matters." Mdm Sa’adah adds, “TSR Time gives me opportunities to get to know my students in my form class better.” By discussing virtues, teachers create a shared vocabulary that helps students understand and internalize important values. This language of virtues forms the foundation for positive character development and ethical decision-making.

**Set Clear Boundaries**

Our commitment to mentorship extends to our House System, introduced in 2021, where we learn and grow together as a supportive community. Teachers actively connect with students and provide guidance. House members participate in team-building activities, fostering rapport within an atmosphere of trust, care, and respect. To support students academically, Teacher Mentors dedicate up to an hour before physical activities to guide self-study sessions. While fostering trust and open communication, our teachers also set clear boundaries to ensure a safe and respectful learning environment. By establishing these boundaries, students understand the expectations for behavior and conduct, creating a structured yet supportive context for virtues to thrive.

**Recognize Teachable Moments**

We celebrate and acknowledge our students' growth through the "GOTCHA! Caught you doing good!" platform, recognizing those who exemplify the Seven Habits and virtues by performing acts of kindness. Through the "GOTCHA!" platform, our teacher mentors actively recognize and celebrate students' acts of kindness and virtuous behavior. By identifying these teachable moments and highlighting them to the entire student body, we promote the values of the Seven Habits and virtues as integral components of personal growth and resilience.

**Honor the Spirit **

Our commitment to mentorship extends beyond academic guidance. We honor the spirit of each student's individuality and potential. At Blangah Rise, we encourage our students to be reflective learners who boldly pave their own paths. Our teacher mentors instill decision-making skills and a growth mindset, empowering students to make informed choices and face life's challenges with courage. Through online conferencing, students gain exposure to inspirational stories of individuals who have harnessed their strengths to overcome obstacles and find their true calling. Julia, a Primary 6 student, excitedly shares her experience: "A barista showed us how to brew coffee online, and it was cool! I also found out about some of the challenges in working in the service industry." By promoting a growth mindset, we encourage them to honor their unique strengths and aspirations. This approach empowers students to develop their identities and pursue their passions.

Our dedication to mentorship extends to our comprehensive Career Guidance program, starting with introductory lessons for Middle Primary students and progressing to in-depth lessons and an annual Careers Fair, to guide them in making informed decisions about their education and careers. We firmly believe in our students' boldness to listen to their hearts and their courage to forge their own unique paths in life. 

**Offer companioning** 

Our teacher mentors walk alongside students as companions on their educational journey. Whether through morning meetings, House System activities, or career guidance, our educators offer companionship and support. This sense of companionship fosters trust, builds self-esteem, and encourages students to navigate their academic and personal challenges with confidence.
Amidst the challenges of life, our commitment at Blangah Rise is to nurture the growth of every Blangahnite. Our educators stand as mentors and companions, walking beside our students on their journey to becoming tomorrow's bold learners equipped with 21st-century competencies.
