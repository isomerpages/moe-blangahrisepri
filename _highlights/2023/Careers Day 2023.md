Blangah Rise Primary School held its Careers Day 2023 on 2 May.

As an old saying goes, “It takes a village to raise a child”, the guest speakers for Careers Day were from our very own Parents Support Group (PSG)

The PSG presented on what their work entails to Primary 4 to 6 students. Coming from diverse professions such as Lead Software Engineer and Investment, the guest speakers gave the students a detailed perspective into what working in industries like Media, Fintech and Investment look like.

“I enjoyed the career fair as we can talk to parents who have very interesting jobs. It allows students to expand their knowledge,” shared Alara from Primary 6 Topaz.

Rian from Primary 6 Topaz also added, “The career fair was beneficial as I learnt about different jobs and got answers to questions on these jobs.”

Through Careers Day, the guest speakers’ presentations inspired our students to work towards their goals and professions.
