<p>The week kicked off with a powerful pledge against cyberbullying. Students
were invited to take photos at a special photo wall set up in the mini
library. Using iPads, students captured their pledges. This visual representation
serves as a strong reminder of our commitment to creating a safe online
environment.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, students participated in the "Puzzle-it-Together" activity,
where they pieced together posters promoting balanced use of technology.
The posters, cut into different parts, challenged students to complete
the puzzles while learning about the importance of managing screen time
effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Handling Online Content through #GetReal</strong>
</p>
<p>The focus on Wednesday shifted to handling online content responsibly.
Students explored the #GetReal Google site on iPads set up in the mini
library. This interactive session provided valuable insights into discerning
credible online content and maintaining a healthy skepticism towards information
encountered on the internet.</p>
<p><strong>Read and Respond</strong>
</p>
<p>Thursday's activity encouraged students to engage with cyber wellness
literature. Students browsed titles like "Cyber Safe - A Dogâ€™s Guide to
Internet Security" and "Cyber Safety - The Interactive Handbook." They
then completed a simple quiz on Student Learning Space (SLS) based on the
books' content. This activity aimed to deepen students' understanding of
online safety through reading and reflection.</p>
<p><strong>Netiquette with Wordwall</strong>
</p>
<p>The week concluded with an engaging netiquette activity using Wordwall.
Slides on were projected in the mini library, accompanied by iPads loaded
with Wordwall questions based on the slides. Students competed to achieve
the highest rankings, with certificates awarded to top performers. This
final activity reinforced the importance of maintaining proper online etiquette.</p>
