<p>The holistic well-being of our students is important to us. There are
four guiding principles that shape our commitment to student well-being:</p>

<p><strong>Principle 1: Total Wellness</strong>
</p>
<p><em>Nurturing a Healthy Body and a Curious Mind</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>Encouraging an active lifestyle is important in building physical well-being.
Our students are encouraged to prioritise regular exercise, enough rest,
and a balanced diet. We encourage our students to be curious and pursue
an area of interest or find their passion. We create opportunities through
House practice to learn a new sport and new skills.</p>
<p>Hannah from Primary 4 shared about her House Practice experience. "Joining
the House Practice sessions makes me feel strong and happy! When I play
and exercise, I feel better and can pay more attention in class."</p>
<p>Therefore, engaging in physical activities boosts overall fitness and
helps our students be more attentive and participative in class.</p>
<p><em>Fostering Intellectual Strengths</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>We believe in nurturing bold learnersâ€”students are not afraid to dive
deep into exploration and questioning. We believe it is important to foster
a growth mindset, where setbacks are viewed as stepping stones for personal
growth.</p>
<p>We design our learning experiences to make students curious and help them
think on their own. We encourage them to be brave in their learning, exploring
new ideas without fear. This way, they become better at handling challenges
and adapting to changes in the world.</p>
<p><em>Building Social Connections</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>We firmly believe in the power of nurturing strong social connections
among our students. We understand that fostering these bonds is essential
for their overall development and success. By encouraging collaboration
and teamwork, we instill in them the value of working together towards
common goals. Through these interactions, students learn to appreciate
diversity and respect differing viewpoints, essential skills for their
future endeavors. Additionally, these social connections provide them with
a support system, contributing to their emotional well-being and resilience.
We design our learning environment to facilitate these connections, creating
opportunities for students to engage with one another, build friendships,
and grow together. Just as we cultivate a growth mindset in academics,
we also strive to cultivate a culture of connection and camaraderie, where
every student feels valued and supported in their educational journey.</p>
<p><em>Developing Inner Resilience</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 50%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2024 Photos/Student Wellness/image009.jpg">
</div>
<p>We want to nurture students to be strong and focused, even when things
get tough. We believe this comes from taking care of our emotions and staying
mindful. We engage in activities such as mindfulness exercises and self-reflection
to foster this strength, alongside supporting others in their journey.
Overall, we want our students to do well in school and become a disciplined
learner, that is one who is able to balance his physical, mental, social
and emotional well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Principle 2: Every Student Matters</strong>
</p>
<p><em>Empowering Students</em>
</p>
<p></p>

</div>
<p>We highly value the voices of our students and thus actively encourage
them to share their thoughts and ideas. One key opportunity we create for
our students is the Class-based monthly Student Wellness Day. We invite
students to contribute their suggestions for activities for this day. By
doing so, we ensure that the activities reflect their interests and promotes
total wellness effectively. Additionally, in-house practices and inter-house
games offer another avenue for student voices to be heard. By allowing
students to form their own teams, they learn to make decisions, fostering
autonomy and empowerment. Furthermore, during the daily pre-assembly Heart-to-Heart
Conversations, teachers make a deliberate effort to reach out to individual
students, seeking to understand more about their needs. This personalised
approach underscores our dedication to supporting each student's academic
and personal development journey, ensuring that they feel heard, valued,
and supported in their endeavours.</p>
<p>Viewpoints (Link to the page), a tiered modular programme, plays a crucial
role in encouraging the student voice within the school community. These
programmes provide dedicated platforms for students to share their perspectives,
opinions, and experiences with their peers through print, photo and broadcast
journalism as well as public speaking. Through these programs, students
not only express themselves but also learn to listen to and respect the
viewpoints of their peers, contributing to a more inclusive and vibrant
school environment.</p>
<p><em>Forging friendships</em>
</p>
<p>We create opportunities for students to form meaningful relationships
with both their peers and teachers. The monthly Student Wellness Day is
eagerly anticipated by all students! These wellness experiences not only
encourage positive contributions to the class community but also foster
a sense of connection and appreciation for the world around them. The experiences
are design also to provide opportunities for our students to practice the
7-habits and virtues they have learnt.</p>

<p>As shared by Ms. Maddie Wong, during the morning exploration of the Garden
of Hope, students engaged in relaxing walks while not only sharing their
observations of plants and animals but also offering each other support
and assistance along the way. These immersive experiences serve to not
only promote well-being but also cultivate close bonds and long-lasting
friendships among students.</p>

<p>As Alicia from Primary 2 beautifully expressed, "The Fukkuwarai game which
we played during Student Wellness Day was fun! I learnt teamwork and active
listening from the activity." Such firsthand experiences highlight the
effectiveness of interactive and engaging activities in fostering not only
academic growth but a lasting sense of camaraderie among students, enriching
their school experience and fostering a supportive community spirit.</p>
<p><em>Level Ambassadors: Advocates for Student Wellness</em>
</p>

<p>Our Level Ambassadors are more than just student leaders; they are dedicated
advocates for student wellness. Equipped with empathy, trustworthiness,
and patience, they undergo comprehensive training, both online and face-to-face,
to fully understand their roles. These ambassadors play a vital part in
fostering a sense of belonging and inclusivity within our school community,
welcoming new students, befriending those who may feel excluded, and promoting
a culture of care in every classroom and peer group.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 80%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/2024 Photos/Student Wellness/SW_3.png">
</div>
<p></p>
<p>Our Level Ambassadors actively help teachers in planning and conducting
Student Wellness Day activities, garnering ideas from their classmates
to ensure relevance and engagement. They take charge of conducting assembly
talks, imparting practical handles to students on various topics such as
cyber wellness and emotional well-being during exam periods. Additionally,
they work with teachers to organize recess activities aimed at promoting
wellness among students, such as cyber wellness pledge card writing, and
activities that promote emotional and mental well-being. Through their
dedication and proactive initiatives, our Level Ambassadors contribute
significantly to creating a safe, inclusive, and supportive learning environment
where every student can thrive.</p>
<p><strong>Principle 3: Every Teacher a Mentor - Guiding, Supporting, and Celebrating Success</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Teacher Mentoring Programme supports our efforts to promote the holistic
well-being of our students. Every teacher is a mentor, guiding students
through their personal growth journey. Our teachers wear multiple hats
at our school, serving as coaches, counselors, and cheerleaders for our
students.</p>
