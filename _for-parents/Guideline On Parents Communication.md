<p>At BRPS, we recognize that school-home partnership is critical in our mission to nurture every child holistically. We value parental involvement and strongly believe that establishing a close partnership will help the child succeed.</p>
<p>Stated below are the guidelines to ensure communication between parents and the school is effective and helpful in supporting the child.</p>
<p><strong>BRPS Guiding Principles</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We aim to partner and collaborate with parents to nurture good habits and virtues as well as a growth mindset in our students.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We aim to balance our teachers&rsquo; workload in partnering parents with our core professional duties in teaching and learning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Guidelines on Parents&rsquo; Communication with the School</strong></p>
<p>1) School&rsquo;s official modes of communication with parents are:</p>
<ul>
<li>School phone: 62717387 (General Office)</li>
<li>School email: brps@moe.edu.sg</li>
<li>School mailing address: 91 Telok Blangah Heights, Singapore 109100</li>
<li>Staff official school email addresses: brps@moe.edu.sg</li>
<li>School website: www.blangahrisepri.moe.sg</li>
<li>Students&rsquo; Handbook issued yearly to each student</li>
<li>Parents should limit communication with teachers to term time and school hours: phone calls or meetings with teachers should be within school hours (7.30am-5pm) on working weekdays during term time (ie Week 1 &ndash; Week 10).</li>
</ul>
<p>3) For urgent messages to teachers, parents may contact the school General Office, if teachers are in class or uncontactable during school hours.</p>
<p>4) Teachers are not expected to respond to parents&rsquo; and students&rsquo; queries after school hours, during weekends and school holidays.</p>
<p>5) Teachers are not expected to provide their personal mobile numbers to parents or students. Teachers are also not required to communicate via social media.</p>
<p>6) Face-to-face meetings with teachers should be arranged in advance: parents are to email the teachers or contact the General Office at least 3 days in advance, to minimise disruption to the teachers&rsquo; teaching duties.</p>
<p>7) In line with Civil Service practice, parents may expect to receive a response to their email queries within a reasonable period of time, so that our staff have sufficient time to ensure that the queries are addressed well:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 working days (Simple query)</li>
<li>7 working days (Query that needs some investigation)</li>
<li>21 working days (Complex query)</li>
</ul>
<p>8) The school reserves the right not to engage with any parent who is disrespectful, rude or abusive to our staff.</p>
<p>We thank you for your support and look forward to an enriching partnership which will help enhance your child&rsquo;s learning and growth in the school and build a positive and effective relationship between the school and parents.</p>
