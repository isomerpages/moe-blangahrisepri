Our school held our Term 1 Inter-House Games for 2024 with the games reflecting our student’s growth from their House Practices. Teachers played a big part during the events as they took on roles such as safety officers, scorekeepers and even referees!
Our Primary 3 and 4 students went to Telok Blangah Hill Park for a 1km Walk-A-Jog. They were encouraged to jog around the park and tackle the different terrains outdoors. The students took on the challenge and completed the course at their own pace.
Our Primary 5 and 6 students were tasked to form their own teams of 3 in their houses as they had a level-based floorball competition. It was a high-spirited event where students were seen cheering for their own houses as the players gave their all during the matches.

Based on the activities, our students shared their learning experiences. 
Mahasina from 4 Opal shared, “My classmates and I were excited to go out of school! We realised that the Walk-A-Jog was a challenging activity, and it required perseverance to complete the jog. Even though we did not win a medal, it was fun to take part in the race together with my friends!” 
Dave from 5 Opal said, “Inter-House Games were interactive and competitive as it raised the level of excitement amongst us. We were grateful that we had the opportunity to learn new skills through the different sports in our school.”
