<h4>Hari Raya Celebrations 2024</h4>
<p>We had a memorable Hari Raya celebration on Tuesday! Kicking off the celebrations
was a mesmerising performance by our Primary 2 students who swayed to the
rhythmic beats of Hari Raya melodies, setting the stage for a joyous occasion.
This year, our festivities revolved around a captivating skit brought to
life by our students. Through the skit, we were immersed in the heartfelt
narratives of three friends sharing their Ramadan and Hari Raya Aidilfitri
experiences. Our students from MOE Kindergarten showcased a traditional
Malay dance to a song as part of the Hari Raya concert.</p>

<p>The concert also featured various performances showcasing our Malay culture,
including Dikir Barat and Silat performances.</p>
<p>Shao Chen from Primary 1 excitedly said, “The Silat performance was so
nice. I like the movements. I want to practice the movements too!”</p>
<p>Ruvanthigaa from Primary 6 cited that the vibrant colours and the energetic
performances captured the spirit of the holiday especially the Dikir Barat
segment.</p>

<p>A heartwarming video montage featuring students sharing their cherished
moments of Hari Raya added a personal touch to the festivities.</p>
<p>As the curtains drew to a close, the students took to the stage once more
for a finale song, echoing our heartfelt wishes of "Selamat Hari Raya Aidilfitri"
to all our Muslim friends. The spirit of unity and joy could be felt in
all of us.</p>

<p>During recess, students engaged in interactive activities such as making
kueh using clay. These activities provided a hands-on experience for our
students to deepen their understanding of the Malay culture. We thank our
Parent Support Group for supporting us in the recess activities and putting
their creativity in action when they decorated our school environment.</p>
<p>"I loved making kueh with clay! I could show my creativity and also learnt
more about the Malay culture!" exclaimed Hannah from Primary 4.</p>
<p>Heidi from Primary 5 said, “I have learnt about the ingredients used for
making kuehs and I would like to make them at home!”</p>

<p>We had a wonderful and meaningful celebration, where learning was engaging
and took place out of the classroom context.</p>
