<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Postcards by our Young Photographers</strong></h4>
<p>&ldquo;I am so excited to be able to put my photography skills to practice and capture the interview sessions through my lenses!&rdquo; exclaimed Aqeel excitedly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While I am able to use the Rule of Thirds in capturing the scene, I get to learn more about the flora and locations which I am at!&rdquo; added Wei Ting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Picture Paints a Thousand Words, and in Blangah Rise Primary School, our Young Photographers leverage photography to tell compelling stories. Their skills learnt are put into practice in authentic settings that provide rich learning experiences beyond the classrooms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Together with our Student Leaders, they worked on a project that aims to use Virtues and reflections from our Singapore Sports Heroes to inspire us in overcoming challenges and these difficult times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a DSLR in their hands, our Young Photographers went to capture scenic locations and flora. Their photographs were selected and made into postcards with inspiring quotes gleaned from our Singapore Sports Heroes when they visited our school for an interview and dialogue session with our Student Leaders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These words of encouragement were captured by our Student Leaders who had learnt valuable lessons which they can apply in school and life. For example, Ms Lim Heem Wei&rsquo;s encouragement to pursue our dreams resonated with 11-year old Gabriel. He said, &ldquo;I will definitely strive to work hard towards my goal and not give up whenever I encounter difficulties.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is truly amazing to see our photography works and inspiring quotes turned into postcards. It enhanced our students&rsquo; learning when they put their writing skills to authentic platforms. They had an opportunity to write to their well-wishes to a local athlete representing Singapore at Tokyo Olympics!</p>
