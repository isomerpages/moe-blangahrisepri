Trees never cling on to dead leaves. Be like a tree and let the dead leaves drop. Let go of the negative thoughts and bad habits that limit us and grow anew.

In Blangah Rise, our holistic education is anchored upon the 7 Habits and also the Virtues Project. In all aspects of school life, our teacher mentors speak the language of virtues to acknowledge and guide our students. Through catching teachable moments and formal lessons, our teachers guide our young to let go of their past selves and set new character goals for themselves. In our CCE/FTGP lessons, our teachers use various scenarios to examine their motives and consider the virtues they choose to uphold.

We support the development of students’ social and emotional skills through multi-pronged programmes. For example, as part of the First Days of School Programme, students go through a curated set of activities to set goals and expectations.

To be more purposeful in their planning of activities beyond school hours, students are mentored by their teachers to plan a schedule that not only consists of homework &amp; revision, but one that also champions a good practice of self-care. At Blangah Rise, we believe that a cornerstone of self-discipline is self-caring. Self-care is never a selfish act. Rest and self-care are important. When we take time to recharge ourselves, it empowers our personal effectiveness and enables us to pursue our goals.

Through the “Healthy Minds, Healthy Blangahnites” initiative, students are also taught ways to calm themselves better and manage their stress more effectively.
