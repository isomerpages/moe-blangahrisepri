<p>Our Primary 3 and 4 students had the opportunity to learn Chinese Language
through an engaging theatrical performance 《环保小天使》at Stamford Arts Centre.
Through the performance, they learnt valuable lessons about the importance
of protecting and caring for the environment.</p>
<p>Carys from 4 Opal shared that she enjoyed the performance and acquired
more knowledge on how to protect the environment. Si Ting from 3 Topaz
appreciated the music accompaniment throughout the performance.</p>
<p>This enriching experience also taught the students valuable lessons in
theatrical etiquette, further enhancing their appreciation and interest
in both the culture and the Chinese language, as well as their understanding
of the arts.</p>
