<p>Congratulations to our Cyberwellness Ambassadors – Ban Xuan Yu, Jesslyn Tan, Nelly Neo, Kristelle Anne Brunidor Pingkian, Enoch Lin and Reeve Aw from Primary 4 Topaz for attaining the Silver Award at NCAC. They created a toolkit – a Snake and Ladder game, which aimed to share ideas and solutions on the topic of managing users’ well-being with mobile devices and screen time. They also shared their outreach plan with a panel of judges at Crescent Girls’ School and gave an Assembly Talk to their peers. In addition, they engaged their peers during recess through their Snake and Ladder game. Through their toolkit, students learnt Cyberwellness tips and how to make wiser decisions with their mobile devises. Well done to our Cyberwellness Ambassadors!</p>
