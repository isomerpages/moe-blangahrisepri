On 15 March 2023, we were awarded three stars â€“ Public Health Star, Environment Protection Star and Junior Environment Ambassador Star under the South West Accreditation Programme for 2022. It was heartening to be affirmed and recognised for our efforts in school-based environmental programmes. These programmes provided authentic platforms for students to explore environmental issues and take action to improve the environment they live in. At the award ceremony, we were given the opportunity to present and share our environmental projects and outreach programmes. It was definitely an enriching learning experience for us.
