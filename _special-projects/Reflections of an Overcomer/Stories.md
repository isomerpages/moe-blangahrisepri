<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Stories of our local athletes by our APEX Writers</strong></h4>
<p>Our APEX Writers decided that it was timely to shine the spotlight on our national representatives at the much anticipated Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Drawing inspiration from the interviews done with 8 local athletes who visited our school in the past 3 years, our APEX writers penned down reflections, poems, commentaries and journal entries celebrating their virtues. Virtues such as resilience, courage and determination inspired the writings and represent the power of the human spirit to overcome and to endure. This is the spirit that inspires us to overcome difficulties as a human race, and as a nation.</p>
