<p>Our Primary 1 and Primary 2 students walked home happily with a pot of succulents on 18 November 2021. The succulents were prepared by the school International Student Permeant Residence (ISPR) Program team. The plants serve as a reminder for students to adopt green habits and practice the virtue of responsibility by taking care of it.</p>
<p>The aim of the ISPR Program is to help students to acquire global awareness, understand the local culture and nurture a sense of belong to Singapore. This year, the school invited National Parks Board to conduct an assembly talk for our Junior Primary students. From the session, students learnt about the unique characters of our local forests. The speaker also introduced the flora and fauna that inhabit in the forest. Our students enjoyed the talk immensely and even learned tips on how to save the environment!</p>
