<p><strong>Learning Environment</strong>
</p>
<p>Students thrive when they have a sense of ownership and belonging. Our
students, though young, contribute to the little corners in the classrooms
which they call their own. The little ones design and display the Emotional
Band Account (EBA) proudly. Notes of appreciation are dropped in by their
peers and teachers. Art work which they did on Growth Mindset and the 7
Habits are also displayed in class as a reminder to self.</p>

<p>A Virtues Challenge Board displays the target virtue which we would like
the students to learn each week and no two boards are alike. As virtues
are best caught and not taught, the visual serves as a reminder for every
one to be on the lookout for those who habitually demonstrate the virtues
in action.</p>

<p><strong>iDiscover Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>As a 7-Habits school, we strive to grow our students progressively in
the maturity continuum where interdependency can be achieved over time
through our school’s programmes. Thus, in line with our mission to develop
students holistically and to provide more fun and meaningful learning opportunities,
all our P1 &amp; P2 students will be involved in a i-Discover programme
unique to the school. The programme will be carried out on Monday, 7.30
am – 9 a.m.</p>
<p>Together with an identified virtue for each term, our students will also
be nurtured in values and basic qualities they need to be successful throughout
their lives. i-Discover will provide opportunities such as CCA experiences,
social skills learning, engagement in the school’s distinctive programmes
and learning journeys.</p>
<p>The following are further details on the programme:</p>

<p><strong>Opportunities for Confidence Building</strong>
</p>
<p>Healthy self-esteem should be inculcated from young, and the Junior Primary
(JP) Team believes every child can be nurtured and learn. Since 2020, we
reinforce self-confidence and resilience in our students when we present
them with the opportunities to showcase their talents while they immerse
themselves in the joy of learning. Teachers teach the skillset necessary
for performance during Music, English Language and Programme for Active
Learning (PAL) lessons. In 2023, through iDiscover Programme, our P1 and
P2 students had the chance to also showcase their talents in both choir
and drama performances during school events.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights from the past years include BRLC Celebrates! Reader
Theatre performance, a handbell performance to commemorate Beethoven’s
250th Anniversary and a virtual choir on National Day.</p>
