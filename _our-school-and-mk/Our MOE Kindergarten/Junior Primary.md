<p><strong>A Taste of Robotics &amp; Engineering for our Primary 1!<br /></strong>Building a smart nation is one of Singapore&rsquo;s top priorities in a bid to keep the city-state relevant in the digital age. STEM education imparts knowledge to students in the disciplines of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. Our Primary 1 students got to take part in STEM activities which consist of Robotics and Engineering-related Learning Activities (ERLA).</p>
<p>To equip our students with coding literacy and computational thinking skills, students took part in the KUBO Robotics and ScratchJr Program. Through this program, students learnt about coding with KUBO. Each student had a hands-on experience using the Kubo kit which consists of a small robot (KUBO) and a set of puzzle pieces (Tagtiles) that fit together to create programming chains. Students explored different coding functions and programmed their robots to move. Putting on their thinking caps, students successfully navigated KUBO through a map and avoided given obstacles. Students also got creative and designed costumes for their KUBO robots and programmed them to move in a KUBO Costume Parade!</p>
