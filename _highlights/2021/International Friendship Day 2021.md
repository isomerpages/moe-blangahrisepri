<p><em>Singapore in the World</em>&nbsp;is the theme for 2021’s commemoration of International Friendship Day, which was held from 7-13 April 2021. A series of activities held throughout the week exposed students to a rich diversity of cultures.</p>
<p>During CCE lessons, students learnt different languages, cultures and traditions of various countries. In line with the theme, students learnt about the importance of collaborating with other countries. In addition, students designed a “virtues card”, using one virtue to expound on the meaning of friendship.</p>
<p>A lesson package was created on the Student Learning Space (SLS) for students to learn more about ASEAN cultures and traditions. Singapore Kindness Movement also conducted a virtual assembly, on the themes of care, respect and friendship, regardless of nationality.</p>
<p>During recess, students were given the chance to experience playing different traditional games. A video screening booth was also set up in canteen for students to learn more about their schoolmates of different nationalities. In the video, International Students introduced their countries and traditions.</p>
<p>It was indeed an engaging and meaningful week for our students. Through the various activities, they learnt to understand and develop the spirit of friendship across different nationalities.</p>

<p>“I am happy to share about New Zealand’s culture and traditions to my schoolmates. I felt nervous to be on camera. However, I am glad that my friends can know more about my hometown.”</p>
