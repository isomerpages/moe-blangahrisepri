<h4>Piala Cendekia 2024</h4>
<p>Our Primary 5 students participated in the Atur Cara Sahibba (Malay Scrabble)
Competition on 18 May. This event provided a platform for the students
to showcase their proficiency in Malay Language. The students achieved
third place in the South Zone, a significant accomplishment that highlighted
their hard work, dedication, and passion for the Malay Language. Competing
against many skilled teams, our students displayed outstanding teamwork
and intellectual strength, bringing pride to our school.</p>
<p>Nurul Illiyyin from Primary 5 expressed her excitement, noting that the
competition taught her there was always room for improvement and she was
determined to perform even better next year.</p>
<p>Fuadah from Primary 4 remarked, “This competition was so fun. It challenges
my thinking and spelling skills. I am thankful to be given this opportunity
and I realised that learning Malay Language can be so enjoyable.”</p>
<p>Congratulations once again to our students for their achievement in the
competition!</p>
