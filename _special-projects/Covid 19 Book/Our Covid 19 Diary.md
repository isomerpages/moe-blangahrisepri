<p>&ldquo;Are you ready? The time starts now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone in Blangah Rise Learning Campus was engaged in&nbsp;<em>Read for Charity</em>, a charity drive conducted by the National Reading Movement. One book would be donated to selected beneficiaries for every 10 people reading for 15 minutes. In previous years, all students and staff would gather in the school hall to read. This year, because of Covid-19, the charity drive was conducted in the classrooms via Zoom.</p>
<p>Amelia, a 9-year-old student, said, &ldquo;I was able to read a book that I liked and do a good deed at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms Junaidah shared that the charity drive was a good experience for the Primary 1 students who were participating for the first time. The students brought a variety of fiction and non-fiction books. They were so engrossed in reading that they did not realise that 15 minutes was up.</p>
<p>Miss Athena added, &ldquo;The older students expressed that they were glad to be able to serve the less fortunate as a whole school community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the timer has stopped, we will continue to cultivate the love of reading in our students and develop them to become caring leaders.</p>

<p>During this unprecedented season, we have seen Singaporeans from all walks of life stepping forward to contribute to the nation in different ways.</p>
<p>According to the authorities, blood collection in the first week of the circuit breaker period dropped to less than a quarter of the usual levels. Blood stocks are required to supply transfusion needs from surgeries, general medicine, and accident and emergency cases.</p>
<p>Mr Shang, our Head of Department for PE and CCA, responded to the appeal of Singapore Red Cross and donated his blood.</p>
<p>We interviewed Mr Shang and asked him to share his experience with us.</p>
<p><em>Q: Why did you respond to the appeal for blood donation?</em></p>
<p><em>A: I used to donate blood when I was younger but somehow stopped. I feel that we can contribute to help others in different ways. If I stay healthy and can donate my blood, I would gladly do so.</em></p>
<p><em>Q: How was the blood donation experience?</em></p>
<p><em>A: Blood donation is a safe process. The average adult has 4 to 5 litres of blood. During a donation, only 350 to 450 ml of blood is drawn. That's only 10% to 12% of the total volume of blood in your body. The fluid (plasma) portion of your donated blood will be replaced in a few days. (Source: Health Science Authority)</em></p>
<p><em>Q: How did you feel after the blood donation?</em></p>
<p><em>A: I felt fine after the blood donation. I had a good dinner and went to sleep. The next day, I did a short run and felt normal. Blood donors can donate blood again after 3 months and I look forward to my next blood donation.</em></p>

<p>It has been a week since all our students returned to school. One of the activities that they look forward to every day is the unstructured playtime during recess!</p>
<p>Safe Management Measures (SMM) are adhered to during unstructured playtime. Sports implements are provided during recess where students could still have fun in a safe manner. To ensure SMM, spot markers are placed at least 2 metres apart for individual students to practise skipping or develop badminton skills.</p>
<p>After play, students would do a wipe down of the sports implements they use. They take responsibility for ensuring that the sports implements are clean and safe for another students&rsquo; use.</p>
<p>Isha, a Primary 2 student, shared, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fun. I get to use the badminton racket to control the shuttlecock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Camille, another Primary 2 student, said appreciatively, &ldquo;At least I get to play. It&rsquo;s better than not being able to play at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Phase 2, we will continue to support our students&rsquo; holistic learning and design positive school experiences. Stay safe, stay active, stay happy.</p>

<p>We ended last Friday&rsquo;s home-based learning for our Primary 4 and 5 students with a series of exciting questions that helped us understand the different perspectives and thoughts of our students. These light-hearted questions also managed to bring out the creativity in our students, and for some, their responses definitely brought smiles to the teachers.</p>
<p>When asked what superpower they would like to have, many students hoped they could fly and teleport to places. They would want to spend time visiting places with their family and friends. Interestingly, Jesslyn, a Primary 5 student, hoped to have special powers to help nature and communicate with animals. She would like to grow more trees and heal the earth, making it well again.</p>
<p>Another question that led to many fascinating responses was &ldquo;In your opinion, what is the BEST occupation in the world?&rdquo; Common responses included: doctors and nurses &ndash; to save lives and help the sick; scientists &ndash; to make important discoveries, produce vaccines and medicine to beat viruses; and YouTubers and software developers &ndash; to create unique online content to engage users purposefully. Certainly, the responses would not be complete if no one pays homage to one of the BEST occupations in the world &ndash; teachers! Zhi Lin, our Primary 4 student, shared, &ldquo;Being a teacher is the best occupation! Teachers do many things. Not only do they teach us in the classrooms, they also teach us the right values.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Today, all our students from Primary 1 to 6 return to school as a community. We look forward to creating many more enriching learning experiences that will help our students achieve their goals and dreams. Onward to Semester 2 in the new normal.</p>

<p><em>Wipe down. Wipe out.</em></p>
<p>More than ever before, Mr Henry Look has been on his toes to ensure the safety of all students and staff in school. As the school&rsquo;s Operations Manager, he oversees estate management, safety and security, and logistics support. These are critical areas to look into for the current two outbreaks &ndash; Covid-19 and dengue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the school holidays, the operations team was busy cleaning and disinfecting different parts of the school like the classrooms, the canteen and the school hall. We even set up safe distancing markers to guide our students &ndash; all in time to welcome our students back to school on 2 June,&rdquo; Mr Look shared with our Chinese Junior Reporter, Jeffrey Zhan Yong Jing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since the re-opening of school in Term 3, I have been at the main gate from 6.30am to make sure that all the students wear their masks properly and have their temperature taken, as well as check that everyone is well when entering the school,&rdquo; Mr Look added.</p>
<p>Jeffrey was curious about the challenges Mr Look faced and how he overcame them. He learnt that it was a challenge to clean the whole school especially when the cleaners were split into two teams during the Circuit Breaker. They reported on alternate days and had staggered work hours. Therefore, he decided to pay more attention to cleaning and disinfecting the areas that would be heavily used by the students.</p>
<p>Mr Look is very proud of his operations team. &ldquo;We are very lucky to have a group of very hardworking cleaners to ensure that the school is properly cleaned and disinfected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Look shared with Jeffrey 3 things that students could do in the fight against COVID-19. Firstly, stay at home if you are unwell and see a doctor. Secondly, wear a mask when you are out. Thirdly, practise safe distancing.</p>
<p>Besides managing Covid-19, Mr Look has also been busy with dengue prevention. After all, we are facing&nbsp;the largest dengue outbreak in Singapore&rsquo;s history. &ldquo;The school carries out anti-pest measures every Tuesday and Friday. We also schedule mosquito fogging on a monthly basis. We have trained our staff, security and even students to frequently scan for potential mosquito breeding grounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Look&rsquo;s face turned serious. &ldquo;We cannot be careless, as mosquito breeding can endanger lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Look is confident that just as our students are now familiar with the Covid-19 wipe-down routine, they are well-versed in the 5-step mozzie wipeout. He emphasised, &ldquo;The best way to prevent dengue is by removing stagnant water in flower pots, vases or buckets, as mosquitoes only need a small puddle of water to start breeding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeffrey ended the interview by wishing Mr Look &ldquo;工作顺利&rdquo; (may everything go smoothly at work) and &ldquo;身体健康&rdquo; (good health).</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been selected to work on a MISSION to create a FUTURE&nbsp;<strong>Blangah Rise Learning Campus</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our P4 APEX students received this note at the start of Term 3. They were being invited to participate in a Design Thinking Programme facilitated by Mr Raziff Lau, a Service Designer from GovTech, and our very own teachers, Mr Patrick Goh and Ms Athena Tang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The future is in your hands. Come and join the mission now!&rdquo; our Vice-Principal, Mrs Leong-Ho Hil May, said in a mission brief shown to the students in the first of six virtual sessions. Students thus joined the Design Squad and embarked on a mission to design a future-facing Blangah Rise Learning Campus. They formed groups to look into four aspects of future school &ndash; Green BRLC, Learning BRLC, Inclusive BRLC and BRLC Community.</p>
<p>To learn the four stages of the design thinking process &ndash; empathise, ideate, prototype and present &ndash; students carried out interesting tasks such as creating a wallet for their peers. They explored the socio-emotional competencies required of design thinking &ndash; empathy and resilience. They learned how to craft meaningful interview questions and carried out interviews with their peers, teachers and parents to truly understand what the &ldquo;end user&rdquo; actually wants.</p>
<p>Yi Kai commented, &ldquo;I learned how to connect with other people and understand their needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through multiple rounds of feedback to refine their ideas, students learned the true meaning of resilience and the importance of not giving up when their first ideas fail. Zhi Lin said, &ldquo;I have learnt ways to improve on something and make it much better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truly, learning happens everywhere, not just within the four walls of the physical classroom. Watch this space for our students&rsquo; creation of Future BRLC!</p>
