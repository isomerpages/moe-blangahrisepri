<p>As the school year draws to a close, we are grateful to all our staff who have gone above and beyond to ensure learning continues despite the challenges that have arisen out of COVID-19. Our parents and students penned messages on the&nbsp;Thank&nbsp;You&nbsp;&lsquo;Cher&nbsp;portal to our staff. Our staff have also reflected on the reasons why they have chosen to teach. Put together, these dedications remind us of our work in education. We wish all our students and teachers a reflective school holiday break ahead!
