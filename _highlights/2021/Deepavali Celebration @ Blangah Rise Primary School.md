<p>Deepavali is a festival that marks the victory of good over evil and light over darkness. Our school celebrated Deepavali on 9 November. Our student emcees, Kaviyarsan Aparajitha (6 Opal) and A.S.Ananthan Kutty (6 Sapphire) shared with us about the origins of Deepavali and how the festival is celebrated in different parts of India.</p>
<p>Did you know that outside of South India, Deepavali is also known as Diwali? Diwali festivities last for 4 to 5 days in West India. In some parts of North India, people let their lamps float on the Varanasi River while giving their prayers. The same festival could be celebrated so differently by the various Indian cultures. During the celebration, some myths were also unravelled. For instance, our students learnt that Deepavali is not celebrated by all Indians. Instead, only Hindus and Sikhs celebrate the festival. Besides that, they also learnt that Deepavali is not an Indian New Year, but rather, it is a festival of lights. The Deepavali celebration ended with a fun-filled quiz segment.&nbsp; All of us learnt more about the cultures from the celebration!</p>
