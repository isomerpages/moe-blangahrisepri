This year, our school is very honoured to present an exhibition at the 12th Mother Tongue Languages Symposium (MTLS) 2023. The symposium took place on 26 August 2023 at Suntec Convention Centre Hall. Our booth “The Junior Reporters @ Blangah Rise Primary School”, received overwhelming response! The booth featured out “The Junior Reporters" programme, designed to prepare students for the 21st Century by developing an awareness of current events in the school and community. The programme enhances Chinese Language skills through an authentic learning and caters to the different readiness of the students. Through this programme, students apply their Chinese Language skills in a real-world context and experience the practicality of Chinese, thereby increasing their interest in learning the Chinese Language.
At the symposium, we showcased our Junior Reporters in action and shared with the visitors how journalistic skills are weaved into our Chinese Language curriculum. Members of the public and fellow educators present on that day shared that they were impressed with the school’s Junior Reporters Programme. 
At the booth, our Junior Reporters interacted with the visitors through a simple snakes and ladders board game. The theme of the board game was related to the Chinese e-Book, “Our Green Dragonflies and their Swampy Friends” produced by our school. Visitors scanned the QR code provided and accessed our e-Book.
Our student presenters from the Junior Reporters- Judith Seow (5 Topaz), Tan Kai Rou (5 Topaz), Cai Suxiang (5 Topaz), Yeo Zheng Hao (5 Sapphire), Shyong, Ruo-Shan (5 Sapphire), Teo Kai Xiang (4 Topaz) and Teo Kai Ting (3 Sapphire) displayed great confidence when speaking to the members of the public. They also facilitated the board game sessions for our younger visitors. 
Zheng Hao shared, “It was such as good experience sharing our school programmes with the public!” Judith also reflected, “I enjoyed interacting with the younger visitors and hope to be able to participate in more of such events in the future.”
This was indeed a good learning opportunity, as the symposium was a great success! We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude for our BRPS parents and all who came by to show us their support for the event.
