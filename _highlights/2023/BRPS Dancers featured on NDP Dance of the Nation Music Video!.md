Blangah Rise Primary School is privileged to be invited by Sports Singapore (SportsSG) to be part of the NDP 2023 Dance of the Nation (DOTN) music video. Eight of our Dance Club members spent an enriching afternoon at the Singapore Sports Hub filming the video with students from other schools and members of the public. 

Catherine of 5 Sapphire shared that she was grateful for the opportunity to take part in the video. “The dance moves seemed hard at first but after a few practices, I was able to master them! I enjoyed the unity amongst everyone there. We were all dancing together and it was great fun!”
