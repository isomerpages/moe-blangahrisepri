<p>Together with our community partners, Blangah Rise Primary School organises
a monthly active ageing programme that promotes intergenerational bonding
between senior citizens and students.</p>
<p>Our teachers and students are privileged to serve the Telok Blangah senior
citizens through this meaningful programme.</p>
<p>Our teachers and students had a meaningful learning experience and shared
their thoughts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"The senior citizens played sports very well. We learnt that even the
elderly on a wheelchair could play sports very well. We were truly inspired."</p>
<p>- Ayden and Syahimina, Primary 4 and 5 Scouts.</p>
<p>"I was very happy to be playing sports with the elderly. It was my first
time playing sports with them. At home, I usually just talk to my grandparents.
From now on, I will try to play sports with my grandparents too!"</p>
<p>- Batrisyia, Primary 5 Scouts.</p>
<p>"It was a very meaningful intergenerational bonding programme. Both the
senior citizens and the students enjoyed themselves. The students had the
opportunity to practise virtues such as care and patience as they taught
sports skills to the elderly. At the same time, the elderly inspired our
students with their joy and enthusiasm."</p>
<p>- Ms Teo Mui Li, Scouts CCA Teacher</p>
<p>“We were thankful that Blangah Rise Primary School and the community partners
organised this monthly programme to bring joy to the Telok Blangah community.
I could see that the students learn patience and love through their interactions
with the elderly. Students were also more aware of the needs of the elderly,
especially those who were handicapped. All these build a more understanding
and caring younger generation.”</p>
<p>- Mdm Sophy, Telok Blangah resident</p>
<p>We are definitely looking forward to the next session!</p>
