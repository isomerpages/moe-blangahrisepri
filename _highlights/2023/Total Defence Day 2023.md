<p>We commemorate Total Defence Day on 15 February to mark Singapore’s surrender to the Japanese in World War II. The theme for 2023 is “Together We Keep Singapore Strong”. Everyone in the community can do their part to keep Singapore safe and strong. The focus is on how students can put Total Defence into action in school and in their everyday lives.</p>
<p>Our Primary 1 to 3 students learnt more on how they could play their part in school by being responsible in following the procedures in emergency drills. They also learnt how they could look out for fire hazards around them. The school also conducted a fire drill to familiarise students with the evacuation route.</p>
<p>Our Primary 4 to 6 students looked at different emergency scenarios in and outside of school. They discussed how they could do their part in an emergency by helping others. Lam Khai from 3 Topaz, dressed up in a fireman costume on Total Defence Day and shared some fire safety tips with his classmates.</p>
<p>Students also rehearsed the codewords which activated the lockdown drill. During the drill, everyone followed the procedures on what they had to do during a lockdown.</p>
<p>Our students reaffirmed their commitment for Total Defence by pledging themselves to be Total Defence Ambassadors. Victoria from 4 Sapphire pledged that she would do her part for Cyber Defence by being careful of fake news and only sharing information from credible sources. Judith from 5 Topaz shared that she would continue to remind everyone on the importance of personal hygiene even with the relaxation of safe management measures.</p>
<p>Indeed, we must not take our safety for granted. Sophia from 6 Topaz shared that she would learn First Aid so that she could help others in an emergency.</p>
<p>Everyone must play a part in Total Defence. Together, we keep Singapore Strong!</p>
