<p>We hosted our inaugural STEM Day on 12 July, in partnership with Stick'Em,
a local social enterprise dedicated to making STEM education accessible
to all. This exciting event aimed to ignite students' passion for Science,
Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) while fostering essential
MOE 21st-century skills such as critical, inventive and adaptive thinking,
as well as communication and collaboration.</p>
<p>The event served as a culmination of the year's STEM activities, allowing
students from Primary 3 to 6 to apply their knowledge and skills in a series
of engaging challenges. Participants were introduced to the concept of
"Tech-for-Good," highlighting the real-world impact of STEM in addressing
global issues.</p>

<p><strong>Hands-On Learning Experiences:</strong>
</p>
<p>• Building Robots with Chopsticks: Students delved into robotics fundamentals,
constructing their own robots using everyday materials like chopsticks.
This hands-on activity promoted ingenuity, problem-solving, and teamwork.</p>
<p>• The Tallest Tower Challenge: Building upon their prior experience in
the Straw Tower Challenge, students collaborated to construct towering
structures using simple 2-D and 3-D connectors. The tallest tower reached
an impressive 2.5 metres, demonstrating remarkable teamwork and ingenuity.</p>
<p>• Robot Relay Race: Teams put their robots to the test in a thrilling
relay race, showcasing their robots' speed, agility, and control.</p>

<p><strong>Parental Involvement</strong>
</p>
<p>Recognizing the importance of parental involvement in a child's learning
journey, parents were invited to participate alongside their children in
STEM Day. Parents formed their own teams to compete against the students,
fostering a fun and engaging environment for shared learning experiences.
This unique approach provided parents with an opportunity to gain firsthand
experience of their child's learning activities and promote a deeper understanding
of STEM education.</p>

<p><strong>Primary 1 and 2 Participation</strong>
</p>
<p>STEM Day was for everyone! Primary 1 and 2 students also had the opportunity
to explore the world of STEM through hands-on activities. Under the guidance
of their teachers, these young learners were introduced to the Stick’Em
construction kits. They learnt how to create various shapes and 3-D solids.
The highlight for them was the Tallest Tower Challenge, where they astoundingly
built towers even taller than themselves, showcasing their creative and
problem-solving skills.</p>
