<p>8 May was World Red Cross Day which marked the founding of&nbsp;Red Cross. It was also a&nbsp;day&nbsp;to pay tribute to our founder Henri Dunant and to all Red Cross volunteers who provided humanitarian services to people.</p>
<p>Wunna, a Primary 6 student, led the Red Cross links as they marched before the rest of the school. Standing proudly in their uniforms, our Red Cross links recited the Red Cross Promise:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We, the members of Singapore Red Cross Society, promise to serve our country and join with others all over the world to help the sick and suffering.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Red Cross is a uniformed group (UG) that teaches students to strive for the best and uphold the spirit of humanity. Our links are trained to be adaptable, resilient and confident team players. We purpose to instill the Red Cross Youth spirit and strengthen core values such as compassion, passion and professionalism&nbsp;in all members.</p>

<p>In Red Cross, our links engage in a variety of activities such as attaining Red Cross knowledge, basic first aid, foot drills and outdoor activities. Through participation in these activities, our links become more resilient and self-disciplined, and learn to serve the community.

<p>Rajalakshmi, a Primary 5 link, says, &ldquo;I enjoy being in Red Cross as I can learn many new things. I learn important skills in first aid and how we can do our part in helping others. We visit the elderly and conduct fun activities with them. Also, we work with other CCA groups and learn from one another through exciting activities!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Akid, a Primary 6 link, adds, &ldquo;We learn to work together as a team through team-building games! We worked together to create a performance for the elderly. It was heartwarming to see the smiles on their faces.&rdquo;</p>
