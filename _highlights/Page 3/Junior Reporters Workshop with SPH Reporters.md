<p>Do you know what constitutes to a good news report? Our Junior Reporters learnt that it must be recent, impactful, special, controversial and at times related to famous people. They had a better understanding on crafting news-worthy articles during the Junior Reporters Workshop conducted by Miss Xie Shangyi and Miss Tan Hui Ting, Journalists cum Sub Editor from SPH Media Trust Young Audience.</p>
<p>Haoyu and Kai Xiang from Primary 3 shared that this was the first time he attended the Junior Reporters Workshop. He enjoyed himself during the workshop and learnt about the qualities of a news reporter.</p>
<p>Athan from Primary 5 shared that he benefited from the workshop. As a Junior Reporter for 2 years, he felt that this workshop further encouraged him to put more enthusiasm into his future work and to report more exciting news to his peers.</p>
