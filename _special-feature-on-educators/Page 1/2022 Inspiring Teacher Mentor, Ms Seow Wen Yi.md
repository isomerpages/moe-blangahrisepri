Inspired by her Chinese Teachers, Ms. Seow Wen Yi aspires to become a teacher who guides and mentors her students. She remembers the days where her teacher would spend time with her to find out more about how she is coping and encouraged her to strive for excellence. Wanting to pass this forward, Ms Seow would check in on her students regularly to provide students with a listening ear when they need it.

As a form teacher, she looks out for student’s mental and physical wellbeing. Together with her co-form teachers, she conducts different activities in the morning such as outdoor games, dance and conversations with teachers. Outdoor games such as traffic lights, freeze tag and real-life Among us are games that students enjoyed playing. She strives to let students start the day right by starting the day on a high note. As a result, students look forward each morning, curious about what they would do that they always ask “What are we doing today?”&nbsp;

Being a Chinese teacher, she understands the struggles students face when learning languages that they are not familiar with. Going the extra mile to counsel and cheerlead, Ms. Seow will try to find pockets of time to have one to one conversations with students to better understand what they are facing and provide them with tips and encouragement. She would also reach out to parents to provide positive feedback to affirm their children's and their efforts in helping them to learn the language. She believes that every student can improve with the right method and a proactive learning attitude. “When we do not score well, she does not scold us, she encourages us. She praises us when we improve.” Comments from her Primary 4 students reassures her that they know that she is there for them.

During House Practice, Ms. Seow would reconnect with students through conversation and games. She feels that House Practice allows her to build relationships with students not in her class and to catch up with her previous students. While students are waiting for their turn to play, Ms. Seow would get students to teach her how to play, giving students a chance to show their skills and not to be afraid to fail. She aims to give students a taste of success and also to feel proud about themselves.

There are times when Ms. Seow finds it difficult to coach certain students. Her colleagues are always willing to share their experience and provide her with a different perspective from where the students are coming from. She values the advice of her colleagues that she would adapt and apply what she has learnt.&nbsp;

十年树木，百年树人，It takes ten years to grow a tree but a hundred years to nurture a person. Ms. Seow’s teaching philosophy is to ensure that her students are able to learn in a safe environment that allows them to grow both academic-wise and character-wise. She believes that by coaching, counseling and cheerleading students, they will be able to reach their full potential.
