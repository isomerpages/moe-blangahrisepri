<p>We support the development of students&rsquo; social and emotional skills as well as those with learning and behavioural needs through multi-pronged programmes. These ensure that our students stay healthy and positive and are competent and confident to achieve success in school.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">As part of the First Days of School Programme, students go through a curated set of activities to build relationships in the classrooms, as well as to set goals and expectations. One of the activities is the &ldquo;Good Words Campaign&rdquo; which advocates the use of good and kind words with one another.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">To be more purposeful in their planning of activities beyond school hours, students are mentored by their teachers to plan a schedule that not only consists of homework &amp; revision, but one that also champions a good practice of self-care.</p>
