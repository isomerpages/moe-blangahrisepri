<p>Our school celebrated Chinese New Year on February 9. The morning buzzed
with activities as students and teachers adorned their classrooms with
creative decorations, infusing them with the spirit of the Chinese New
Year. Walking through the school, one could not help but admire the festive
atmosphere.</p>
<p>We then gathered in the hall for the Chinese New Year concert. We welcomed
the elders from the Lions Befrienders Club and parents from Parent Support
Group to join us in the celebrations.</p>
<p>The concert commenced with a captivating lion dance performance, where
the lions moved to the rhythmic beats of drums and cymbals. setting the
tone for the celebrations. Our School Leaders and teachers conveyed their
New Year wishes to everyone through a heartfelt video presentation. Following
this, our students from Dance Club graced the stage with their lively performances,
and our MK students delighted us with their dance and song renditions of
popular Chinese New Year melodies. Delving into Chinese New Year traditions,
our Primary 3 students presented a skit highlighting common practices,
which then fostered awareness among us.</p>
<p>The international flair of our celebration was enriched as our international
students shared their own experiences of Chinese New Year from their countries.
Additionally, our Primary 6 students showcased their talents with the "kuai
ban," a percussion musical instrument, infusing the air with festive cheer.
Not forgetting a delightful musical performance featuring both drumming
and a beautiful recorder piece by our Primary 4 students.</p>
<p>We were invigorated by a mass exercise led by our teachers, synchronised
to the beats of Chinese New Year songs, further elevating our spirits.
Reflecting the diversity of our school, our Primary 2 Tamil and Malay students
confidently sang and danced to the Chinese New Year songs, embodying the
essence of multicultural exchange. Furthermore, three of our students enthralled
the audience with a captivating Chinese dance performance, ushering in
the New Year spirit.</p>
<p>Kai Xiang from 5 Topaz shared that he enjoyed the performance particularly
the Kuai Ban performance and the Lion Dance. He felt that the mass dance
was lively and engaging.</p>
<p>Marissa from 4 Topaz was very happy to perform the recorder piece during
the celebration with her friends. She felt that the celebration was very
exciting and fun.</p>
<p>The grand finale was marked by an engaging game segment hosted by our
parents from Parent Support Group, leaving everyone in high spirits. As
the concert drew to a close, we came together as one big Blangah Rise family,
singing melodious Chinese New Year songs and presenting oranges to our
elders, parents, and teachers.</p>
<p>We extend warm wishes to everyone for a joyous Chinese New Year!</p>
<p>新年快乐、国泰民安！</p>
