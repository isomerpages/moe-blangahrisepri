**Fostering AI Innovation through the ‘Scientist-in-School’ Programme**

We participated in the Scientist-in-School programme, an initiative organised by the Ministry of Education (MOE) of Singapore. This programme establishes a collaborative framework between schools and A*STAR researchers, aiming to nurture student interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. The programme’s core objectives are:

<p>•	to expose students to the practical applications of STEM within real-world contexts.</p>
<p>•	to provide students with inspirational figures and role models in STEM professions.</p>
<p>•	to support the ongoing enhancement of STEM education within participating schools.</p>

**AI-Powered Attendance: A Student-Led Project**

Under the mentorship of Dr. Zhou Jun (A*STAR), our Primary 6 APEX students embarked on a comprehensive exploration of the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Investigating AI's potential impact on everyday life, the students conceived a self-directed project: the development of an AI-powered application automating student attendance tracking through facial recognition technology.

**Project Phases and Learning Outcomes**

The project encompassed the following key phases:

<p>•	Machine Learning Foundations: Students acquired a solid understanding of the principles underlying machine learning.</p>
<p>•	Microcontroller Programming: Students developed proficiency in programming with microcontrollers (specifically, micro: bit).</p>
•	Facial Recognition Integration: The incorporation of a specialised camera module (Huskylens) brought facial recognition capabilities into the project.

**Challenges and Student Growth**

The project presented technical hurdles, providing valuable problem-solving and resilience-building opportunities. Initial difficulties included hardware connections and software installation. Early versions of the program demonstrated limited facial recognition capacity. Throughout the process, students persevered, engaging in extensive debugging and code refinement to achieve successful implementation.

Khush from Primary 6, shared what he had learnt, "Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines to exhibit behaviors that mimic human cognitive functions.  Machine learning enables AI systems to improve their performance over time by learning from data, allowing them to execute tasks that might exceed our own capabilities."

Mills from Primary 6, highlighted the challenges he faced, "I overcame these challenges by seeking guidance from my teacher on the proper Huskylens connections and requesting for additional instruction. This allowed me to revise my code independently."

**Program Impact**

Students proudly showcased their AI-powered attendance application during one of the school assembly sessions. The presentation introduced fellow students to the concept of artificial intelligence through a working demonstration. The project inspired others to consider undertaking their own creative endeavors, showcasing the potential for AI development among primary school students.

The 'Scientist-in-School' programme is transformative in its approach as it not only provides students with valuable scientific knowledge but also cultivates essential 21st-century skills. By engaging with scientific experts and facilitating collaboration between educators and researchers, this initiative ignites a passion for STEM subjects and fosters the critical thinking, communication, and collaboration skills necessary for scientific inquiry.
