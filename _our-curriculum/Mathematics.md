<p><strong>Vision:<br></strong>Creative and confident problem solvers who have a passion for Mathematics</p>
<p><strong>Mission:<br></strong>To develop reasoning, thinking skills and problem solving skills in every child</p>
<p><strong>MOE Mathematics Framework:</strong></p>
<img src="/images/Math-Framework.png">
<p>The central focus of the framework is mathematical problem solving, that is, using mathematics to solve problems. The framework stresses conceptual understanding, skills proficiency and mathematical processes, and gives due emphasis to attitudes and metacognition. These five components are inter-related.</p>
<p><strong>Approach<br></strong>We believe that all students can learn and want to learn Mathematics. We create opportunities for all students to be actively engaged in learning Mathematics. We foster positive attitudes in students towards Mathematics and make learning fun and meaningful through a variety of learning experiences.
</p>
<p>
Using manipulatives such as cubes, fraction discs and place value cards provide our students with concrete representations of abstract mathematical concepts, which make those concepts easier to understand.

Additionally, incorporating authentic examples from everyday life make learning of mathematics more relevant and meaningful to students. By connecting mathematical concepts to real-world situations, our students can see how Mathematics is used in their daily lives and understand its practical applications. This approach can also help our students develop problem-solving skills and critical thinking abilities as they apply mathematical concepts and skills to solve real-world problems.

</p><p><strong>Use of ICT<br></strong>
We hope infusing thinking routines and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools into lessons can enhance student engagement and understanding. 
</p>
<p>
For example, the ‘See, Think, Wonder’ Thinking Routine encourages students to observe, analyse, and question real-life situations through the lens of mathematical concepts. By prompting them to "see" what's happening, "think" critically about the mathematical concepts involved, and "wonder" about potential solutions or implications, students develop a deeper understanding of how mathematics applies to the world around them. 
</p>
<p>
The Student Learning Space (SLS) provides an online learning platform where students can access learning resources, collaborate with peers, and engage in interactive learning activities. Through SLS, students have the flexibility to explore concepts at their own pace and receive immediate feedback, fostering a more personalised learning experience.

<p></p><p><strong>Description of programmes:<br></strong><strong>E2K Mathematics Programme</strong></p>

<p>Our students in the&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>ccelerated&nbsp;<strong>P</strong>rogramme to&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>nhance students’ e<strong>X</strong>perience (APEX) attend the E2K Mathematics Programme. The materials are taken from the MOE Gifted Education Branch. We aim to develop students’ mathematical reasoning skills and deepen their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach.</p>
<p>The students gave positive feedback about the programme. “We look forward to every lesson as we get to solve challenging puzzles. We are happy to work with our friends to discuss and solve them. We present our solutions to our teachers and friends so that they can help us improve.”</p><p>
	
</p><p><strong>LEGO Building<br></strong></p><p>The creative process of building with lego engages students in a hands-on and interactive experience that promote mathematical thinking.  The construction of lego objects involves problem-solving skills as students plan and analyse the pieces they have, envision the desired outcome and figure out required steps to achieve it. They develop spatial and pattern reasoning ability as they visualize how different pieces fit together.</p>

<p><strong>Mathematics Olympiad<br></strong></p><p></p><p>Mathematics Olympiad workshops are organised for selected Primary 4 to 6 students to nurture their interest and talent in Mathematics. Students who demonstrate exceptional performance and dedication can be selected to represent the school in external Mathematics competitions such as Asia-Pacific Mathematical Olympiad for Primary Schools (APMOPS), Raffles Mathematical Olympiad (RMO), Visual Spatial Mathlympics and Annual Mathlympics.</p>



<p><strong>BRPS Math Challenge<br></strong>Students have the opportunities to take part in challenging, fun and engaging math challenge activities every term. These activities include magic number, sudoku, secret codes and multiplication tables. 

Students build confidence and resilience as they persist and persevere to solve problems. The results are displayed on the level board to celebrate students’ success. Learning is made joyful and enriching for students. </p>

The objectives of Math Challenge are as follows:

	•	Enhance mathematical knowledge and skills - students deeepen their understanding of various mathematical topics and improve their mathematical fluency

	•	Promote mathematical skills - students think critically and creatively to solve the problems

	•	Inspire interest in mathematics - spark enthusiasm and curiosity in students

<p><strong>Math Star Award</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Hard work&nbsp;</em><em>&nbsp;Perseverance = Success</em></strong></p>
<p>The Math Star Award recognizes students who have exhibited proficiency and shown exceptional potential in mastering mathematics. The award nurtures a sense of pride and encouragement in learning mathematics. Students are inspired and motivated to pursue excellence in mathematics.
 “I am delighted to win the Math Star Award this term. I will continue to do my best in math. I hope to win the award next term again,” says Zheng Hao, a Primary 5 student, proudly.

<p><strong>Fun with Math Programme<br>
	The Parent Support Group (PSG) works collaboratively with the school to enhance the learning experience and academic success of students. Students are engaged in math games and a variety of activities that include story-telling to build students’ factual fluency and foster interest in learning math.
“I look forward to the Fun with Math programme. I used to think math is difficult. Now I think I can do the math questions and I want to do more, says Cindy, a Primary 2 student.
