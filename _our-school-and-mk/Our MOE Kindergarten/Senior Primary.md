<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>WE&nbsp;<em>LEARN</em>&nbsp;AS ONE<br /></strong><strong>WE&nbsp;<em>PLAY</em>&nbsp;AS ONE<br /></strong><strong>WE&nbsp;<em>SUCCEED</em>&nbsp;AS ONE</strong></h4>
<p><strong>A note from the Year Head, Mdm Stephanie Song and Assistant Year Head, Mr Leow Qinjin<br /></strong>Welcome to Senior Primary!</p>
<p>Motivation and support from teachers and friends are the drivers to our children&rsquo;s success. This year, we have planned many level programmes and activities that focus on building the camaraderie between students and teachers.</p>
<p>The programmes planned not only extend learning beyond the classroom, but they also make lessons come alive for our students.</p>
<p>We look forward to your continued partnership!</p>
<p><strong>Note to Parents for Term 1<br /></strong>A new year marks a new beginning. Let&rsquo;s work together hand-in-hand, to help the students start afresh in 2022. As we are still in the midst of COVID-19 endemic, please rest assured that we will adhere strictly to the different SMM measures when planning and conducting the various class and level activities. Please do encourage your child to observe good hygiene habits by washing and sanitising their hands frequently and also ensure that they have spare masks in their bags. It is also important to have their TraceTogether tokens with them at all times.</p>
<p>Having ample rest the night before a school day will maximise a student&rsquo;s ability to concentrate during lessons and minimize the possibility of missing out important concepts in class. Therefore, please do ensure that your child sleeps early at night so he/she can be fully energised and be all ready to start the new day. Do encourage your child to be proactive by reminding him/her the importance of packing his/her schoolbag daily. Having the necessary stationary and books will help your child to be prepared for lessons. This will also help to ensure that your child&rsquo;s school bag is not overly heavy.</p>
<p>Lastly, teach and guide your child to prioritise and put first things first, ensure that all homework and revision stated in the student&rsquo;s diary is done before they turn in for the night. By completing school work at home, your child not only can revise the concepts taught but also allow subject teachers to address the learning gaps and misconceptions from their work.</p>
<p>Together, we can make a difference and help your child develop holistically and achieve his/her fullest potential. We look forward to working together with you.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,<br />Mdm Stephanie Song &ndash; Year Head Senior School<br />Mr Leow Qinjin &ndash; LH Science / Assistant Year Head Senior School</p>

<p><strong>P5 Code for Fun Programme<br /></strong>Look at the glow on our Primary 5 pupils&rsquo; faces upon witnessing their own Sphero Bolts spinning and lighting up according to their programming! Today, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become commonplace in daily lives. Hence, in BRPS, we see the need to expose our students to basic programming and coding skills.</p>
<p>In Term 2, our Primary 5 students went through a series of workshops where they learnt Computational Thinking through basic coding. In this enrichment class, students learn computational thinking and making, and are exposed to coding concepts through a blend of software input (visual/syntax-based programming language) and hardware output (Robotics and Microcontrollers). They even made use of their newly found skills to play traditional game like &lsquo;Scissors, Paper, Stones&rsquo; with one another! Let&rsquo;s hear what our students thought of this programme:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I enjoyed the program very much. I learnt how to code the Sphero, make it light up with different flash lights and control its movement. I think that learning coding will make our lives easier in the future!&rdquo;&nbsp;<em>(Rian Hong, 5 Topaz)</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;I had so much fun! I was able to control the robot&rsquo;s movement. I hope that in the future I am able to program robots to help my family with housework!&rdquo; <em>(Lin Zesheng, 5 Topaz)</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;It was fun and engaging! I get to play with robots and I learnt how to programme them. I aspire to be a game developer when I grow up!&rdquo;&nbsp;<em>(Tam Chi Fung, 5 Sapphire)</em></p>
