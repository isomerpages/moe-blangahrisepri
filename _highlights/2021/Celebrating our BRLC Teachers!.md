<p>The school came together on Teachers’ Day to celebrate our beloved teachers. The day started off with an encouraging message from our principal Mr Foo, who unpacked the meaning of teaching and deep purpose of the profession. After the message from Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education, the concert swung into action. We first enjoyed a series of videos created by the Ministry of Education celebrating the teaching profession. These videos reminded us of the deep commitment from our teachers. "The performances allowed me to think back on the times where my teachers were always there&nbsp;for me. The joy of being able to light up smiles on my teachers' faces is indescribable," Aggie shared.</p>
<p>This was followed by a video highlighting the unique talents of our students. We were blown away by the beautiful musical performances and magic tricks by our students. “We love our teachers,” the lyrics went in the performance put up by our Senior Primary and Middle Primary students. The little ones from the MOE kindergarten proceeded to charm everyone with their delightful dance. Although this format of celebrations differed from the exuberant celebrations of previous years, it was no doubt still a heart-warming one. &nbsp;"I enjoyed the Teachers' Day Celebration even though it is not as grand as celebrations before Covid, where students would perform on stage. I will definitely&nbsp;miss my teachers after I graduate," shared Hannah from 6 Opal.</p>
<p>Finally, our active Parent Support Group showed their appreciation for teachers through a live speech and appreciation video. As the concert drew to a close, students presented all teachers with a token of appreciation. Before the celebration ended, teachers bonded with students through games and class activities. It was a memorable and fun-filled day for everyone!</p>
<p>“Even though celebrations were held virtually, I could feel the warmth and sincerity of the students. I particularly&nbsp;enjoyed the video compilation of performances by students!" Miss Esther Teo said.</p>
