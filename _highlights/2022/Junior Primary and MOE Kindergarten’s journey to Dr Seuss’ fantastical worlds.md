<p>Our Junior School celebrated Dr Seuss Day on 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;March 2022, a day shy of his birthday. What better way to commemorate the author’s illustrious works than to explore his writings?</p>
<p>Throughout Term 1, our teachers introduced Dr Seuss’s oeuvre to our Blangahnites and engaged our students with language learning activities. The Primary Ones came up with their own versions of&nbsp;<em>Dr Seuss’s ABC</em>&nbsp;by emulating his alliterative style. The Primary Twos rehearsed their readings of a couple of the writer’s texts, including&nbsp;<em>The Foot Book</em>,&nbsp;<em>Ten Apples Up On Top</em>,&nbsp;<em>Hop On Pop</em>&nbsp;and the famous&nbsp;<em>Green Eggs And Ham</em>, which the author cleverly used only 50 different words to compose!</p>
<p>On the day of celebration, the students eagerly put on their Cat-in-the-Hat headpieces and like adoring fans, waited for their idol. The Cat-in-the-Hat mascot eventually dropped by for a visit and shared that he could read with his eyes shut! Amazing! Even the MOE Kindergarten preschoolers were entertained by The-Cat-in-the-Hat via a pre-recorded video as they learnt about their left and right feet.</p>
<p>It was truly encouraging to see our young Blangahnites reading Dr Seuss’s books from their class library collections, and it was even more heart-warming to hear them chant excerpts from his verses. Indeed, we have ignited a spark that lit the way for our students to explore the world of reading. All these are the school’s efforts to promote the love for reading in our children.</p>
<p>To quote Dr. Seuss himself, “You can find magic everywhere you look. Sit back and relax, all you need is a book!”</p>
