<p><strong>TEO KAI TING, 4 Sapphire</strong>
</p>
<p>I used the compostion techniques of Rule of Thirds and Layering to capture
my photographs. My photographs inspire me to dream big, even if we are
small. Rain or shine, big or small, pursuing our dreams always requires
courage, perseverance and determination. As a student, I will seize the
opportunity to take my first step, just like the small plant. Although
I am small, I have the chance to grow, just like the plant. Every step
I take requires time and effort. Though I do not have a clear dream yet,
I can start small and dream big.</p>

<p><strong>TEO KAI XIANG, 5 Topaz</strong>
</p>
<p>I used the compostion technique of Rule of Thirds to capture these photographs.
My photographs inspire me to realize that we need to take the first step
out of our comfort zone, and embrace every step and opportunity, rather
than skipping steps. The Lego character exemplifies someone who is willing
to take that first step to reach his dream. However, some of us might not
knwo what our dream is. I believe it is possible to try everything in life
to discover it. These photographs remind me of the virtues of resilience
and perseverance that I have learned in school. Let’s pursue our dream.
We may not know what is beneath us, but there is always something beyond
us.</p>
<h4><strong>Honourable Mention</strong></h4>

<p><strong>LEIA LAY YI XUAN, 4 Opal</strong>
</p>
<p>“ Look! Such a huge tall tree! How I wish I could reach as high as the
tree."</p>
<p>The miniature girl dressed as an artist, which I made out of clay, represents
me. Trees are symbols of growth and strength, with their roots providing
a solid foundation—just like how a person needs a strong foundation to
achieve their dreams. I love visual art because I like to draw, sculpt
with clay and take photographs. Drawing anime is my current favorite activity.
It makes me feel relaxed and relieves my stress. I wish I can pursue my
dream in Art.</p>

<p><strong>ANG ZI NING, CARYS, 4 Opal</strong>
</p>
<p>I want to be a photographer when I grow up. Taking photographs is one
of my favourite things to do. Photography has taught me to be patient,
as the subject that I wish to capture might not always be in the frame.
Therefore, it is important to be prepared, and wait for the right moment
to capture the scene.</p>
<p>My father is an avid photographer who often goes out into nature and to
take photographs of special species of birds. My MediaKids CCA instructor
and teachers have also taught me advanced composition techniques, which
I could apply to tell stories through my lenses. As such, they are my inspiration
and I hope to achieve my dream of being a photographer!</p>

<p><strong>KRYSTAL YE CAI HONG, 4 Sapphire</strong>
</p>
<p>This photograph shows a tree that is growing taller and taller to pursue
its dreams — to reach for the skies. I took this photograph to illustrate
how the tree continues to grow, never giving up. Trees often grow to a
certain height before being cut down by humans, but this one is seizing
the opportunity to grow as much as possible while it can. I believe we
should all take inspiration from this tree and make the most of our opportunities
before it’s too late.</p>

<p><strong>NATALIE ELISE GARDE LAWENKO, 5 Topaz</strong>
</p>
<p>This photograph captures a climber’s shoe and chalk bag — a reflection
of my dream to become a professional climber. It represents not just a
love for the sport, but the unwavering determination to push my limits
and improve with every climb. As I pursue my dream of joining the ranks
of the world's best climbers, these photographs serve as a reminder that
success is built on perseverance and passion. Just like this, I believe
that with hard work and dedication, we can all chase our dreams and turn
them into reality.</p>

<p><strong>TEMPERANCE LEE YAN XI, 5 Sapphire</strong>
</p>
<p>These photographs were taken at the pond outside my block, where a LEGO
minifigure stands as a symbol of a Singapore citizen, and the water represents
Singapore's ongoing journey towards a clean and sustainable water supply.</p>
<p>My dream is to contribute to this vision — helping Singapore take meaningful
steps toward ensuring a greener, more sustainable future. This journey,
like the pursuit of any dream, requires innovation, commitment, and a shared
desire for progress. I hope to be part of that transformative effort.</p>
