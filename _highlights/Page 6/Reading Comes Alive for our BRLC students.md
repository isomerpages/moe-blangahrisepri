<p>&ldquo;What do you use to draw your pictures with?&rdquo;, &ldquo;How long do you take to write a book?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What advice would you give me if I wanted to be a writer?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why is Sherlock Sam always wearing a shirt with &lsquo;Ad&rdquo; on it?&rdquo; These were just some of the questions that Blangahnites posed to our visiting local authors, Mr Quek Hong Shin, A.J. Low and Ms Sharon Ismail, who zoomed with them as part of our&nbsp;<em>BRLC Authors&rsquo; Talk Series</em>.</p>
<p>Our Primary 1 to 3 students were introduced to local cultures such as how the&nbsp;<em>tok tok</em>&nbsp;man plied his trade, selling noodles on the streets in the early years of Singapore. Our Primary 4 and 5 students got a glimpse of what inspired the husband-and-wife writing duo, A.J. Low, to base their stories around local sites from Fort Canning to Pulau Ubin. From them, they learnt more about the narrative development of the famed Sherlock Sam series. Finally, our Primary 6 classes discovered the truth behind the story,&nbsp;<em>What Sallamah Didn&rsquo;t Know</em>. Themes such as family and identity were discussed, and students were thrilled to participate in an author&rsquo;s quiz, bringing home Ms Sharon Ismail&rsquo;s new book The Ghost with Dirty Feet as their next reading.</p>
<p>All in all, the sessions ushered the students towards the collections of the authors highlighted. The&nbsp;<em>BRLC Authors&rsquo; Talk Series</em>&nbsp;is our commitment to make reading come alive for our students. The talks have prompted them to explore the array of stories hidden in books, waiting to be discovered.</p>
