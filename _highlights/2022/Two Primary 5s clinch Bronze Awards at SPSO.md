<p>The Singapore Primary Science Olympiad (SPSO) is an annual national competition organized by the NUS High School of Mathematics and Science. The competition aims to nurture talents in the Sciences and to cultivate enthusiasm and instil a passion for science subjects among Primary school pupils.</p>
<p>Hong Rian (5 Topaz) and Lionel Lim (5 Sapphire) did our school proud by clinching the Bronze Medal and Merit Award in the competition this year respectively. Both Rian and Lionel have strong interests in Science and had spent weeks attending training sessions to prepare themselves for the competition. Rian is also currently exploring her interests in Science by attending the MCurie Programme organised by NUS High School of Mathematics and Science. "To better prepare myself for the Science Olympiad, I had asked my parents to shift the timing of my enrichment classes so that I can commit to all the training sessions of the Science Olympiad training," Rian said. Through the training sessions, she gained valuable tips and knowledge that enabled her to perform at the competition. Lionel also worked hard to achieve the award. He shared, "I spent my free time reading Science encyclopedias to widen my knowledge on the various Science disciplines."</p>
<p>Congratulations Rian and Lionel on winning the award!</p>
