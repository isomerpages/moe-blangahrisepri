<p><strong>Chen Yi Jia: Semi-Finalist at the 37th Plain English Speaking Awards</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are thrilled to shine a spotlight on one of our students, Chen Yi Jia
from 4T, who proudly represented our school in the 37th Plain English Speaking
Awards (PESA) this year. Yi Jia demonstrated her dedication by stepping
out of her comfort zone to participate in PESA, advancing to the Semi-finals
and showcasing impressive public speaking skills.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yi Jia reflected on her PESA journey, highlighting the personal growth
and new skills she gained along the way. Initially nervous, she found herself
becoming more confident through continuous practice, embracing the challenge
of public speaking. She expressed her gratitude for the strong support
from her parents and the guidance of Ms. Maddie Wong, who played key roles
in helping her prepare for PESA. Their encouragement and support were invaluable
to her success.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As Yi Jia concludes her public speaking journey this year,&nbsp; she looks
to the future with renewed confidence. Her experience in the 37th PESA
is a testament to her resilience and growth. We congratulate Yi Jia on
her achievements and look forward to seeing her continued development!</p>
