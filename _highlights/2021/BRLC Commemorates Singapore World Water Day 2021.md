<p>On 23 March, BRLC commemorated Singapore World Water Day through a series of activities. Students were educated on the importance of using water wisely and cherishing our water resources. In view of safe management measures, an assembly talk was conducted by form teachers in the classrooms with resources prepared by the school’s Learning for Life Program (LLP) team.</p>
<p>To enhance learning, recess activities such as Learning Stations at out Mini Library and Video Screenings at our school canteen were organized. Science teachers took the lead to run two hands-on activities at these learning stations. At one station, students had the opportunity to view water samples using digital microscopes, and observe the presence of sediments and microscopic organisms. “The activity was very fun. I learnt that water that looks clean to us may not be suitable for drinking as there may be germs or chemicals in it,” &nbsp;Ghim Suan, a Primary 4 student, shared.</p>
<p>At another station, students were provided with litmus papers to test pH levels of different sources of ‘rain water’. “I learnt that different water sources have different pH levels. Some may be acidic while others are too alkaline. It is important to ensure the water we have is safe for drinking. I enjoyed the activity as I got to learn something new,” Qihan, a Primary 6 student, reflected. Through the two activities, students learnt that not all sources of water are potable.</p>
<p>Students also learnt how Singapore harnesses the power of technology to conserve water, in our effort to be a self-sustaining nation. The canteen was converted into a mini cinema so that students could watch these videos while having their meals. To extend the learning, our APEX students had the opportunity to conduct their own research on Marina Barrage to find out how our government constructed a barrage to solve the problem of flooding as well as to create a catchment for rainwater. In line with our Applied Learning Programme (ALP), the APEX students then created a simple robotic floodgate to simulate those used at the barrage.</p>
<p>All in all, it was a holistic commemoration of World Water Day, as our Blangahnites came to appreciate why we should waste no drop!</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;“World Water Day is meant to be a call to action. Responsibility lies with all of us. Governments, associations, private partners: we must all recognize the multifold value of water and take action to conserve this basic resource, the resource which gives our planet its unique colour.”</em></p>
