Each April, we commemorate this annual event with assembly talks, class activities, recess activities and Project Green Awareness in Action (GAIA). The theme for this year’s Earth Day in 2023 is ‘Invest in Our Planet’. We collaborated with Telok Blangah Community Club (Youth Network) and Cloop to organize an upcycling workshop where our students brought along their old T-shirts and transformed the shirts into tote bags instead of throwing them away. These functional and eco-friendly tote bags will be donated to the community.

In addition, our Parent Support Group (PSG) promoted greening our corridors by engaging our students in growing plants using recycled bottles. During their recess, students also adopted a plant for their classes. The Green Ambassadors in each class helped to water and care for the plants assigned to each class which were put on display in some classes during our Parent Teacher Conference in May. We're so proud of these young upcyclers and the positive impact they're making on the environment!
