<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Children live up to what we believe of them.<br /></em></strong><strong><em>We believe that every child wants to learn and can learn.</em></strong></h4>
<p><strong>A note from the Year Head, Mr Patrick Goh and Assistant Year Head, Mr Victor Lim<br /></strong>The Middle Primary is a robust team formed by talented and creative teachers who will combine their strengths, skills and ideas to work together to enrich your child&rsquo;s time in school. My colleagues and I aim to nurture your child to the best of our abilities. We believe in establishing a strong partnership and an open communication with parents.</p>
<p><strong>A note to parents&nbsp;<br /></strong>We would like to welcome you and your child/ward to a brand new school year. We hope that the recent school break was enjoyable and well-utilised for you and your child/ward. We are delighted to see the students back in school, healthy and happy.</p>
<p>Our role is to look into all student development matters including general discipline matters and provide intervention strategies where necessary. In addition, we will monitor the Middle Primary students&rsquo; progress and work together with the teachers to address areas of growth for your child/ward so as to give your child/ward a positive school experience this year.</p>
<p>Thank you for your partnership and support in your child&rsquo;s/ward&rsquo;s education. We look forward to an exciting year of learning and growth for your child/ward.</p>

<p><strong>LEARNING ENVIRONMENT<br /></strong>Our students love to come to school and enjoy learning because our teachers create a non-threatening and conducive environment that welcomes them. Our students beam with pride when the teachers regularly put up their good work done in class!</p>

<p><strong>LEVEL PROGRAMMES IN 2020</strong></p>

<p><strong>Project SPARK<br /></strong>In our continuous effort to support our students holistically through meaningful activities and enjoyable school experiences, our creative teachers designed an after-school interest club programme &ndash; Project SPARK. This programme aims to ignite our students&rsquo; interests in indoor and outdoor sports, experiential activities such as art, music and dance, robotics and gardening, and activities that enhance our students&rsquo; general knowledge in civic literacy and global awareness. Most importantly, we would like to build our students&rsquo; sense of belonging to the school and team spirit with their schoolmates.</p>

<p><strong>Learning for Life Programme (LLP) &ndash; Project GAIA<br /></strong>Our students seek support from the residents in the school&rsquo;s neighbourhood to donate their recyclable items.
