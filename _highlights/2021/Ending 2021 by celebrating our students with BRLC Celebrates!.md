<p>2021 ended on a high with a three-day event,&nbsp;<em>BRLC Celebrates!,</em>&nbsp;our annual Speech and Prize Giving event. This year is our second time hosting the event online.</p>
<p>Students took pride and were actively involved in decorating their classrooms to the days leading to the event. The decoration for every classroom was unique and was the pride of the students of the class. Hannah, 6 Opal, shared, “The teachers certainly made this year’s celebration feel special as we got to decorate our own class in any way we wanted. The P6s got to see how much each of us grew in all the photos and videos shown. It was very emotional. Many of my classmates teared. It was an unforgettable last day of school!” Aggie, also from 6 Opal, added that decorating the classroom helped her foster closer bonds with her classmates and she really enjoyed the experience.</p>
<p>Every level put up a performance for the event this year. Lucas, from 4 Topaz, quipped, “I enjoyed the P6 performance of the finale song. It was their graduation gift to the school. I feel that the performances were a good opportunity for us to showcase our talents.”</p>
<p>The teachers also shared on their thoughts for the event. They too saw a side of their class not seen in their everyday interactions with the students. Ms Esther Teo said, “<em>BRLC Celebrates!&nbsp;</em>was a meaningful event for my form class (1 Opal). My students were thrilled to decorate the classroom and our class spirit was evident in our unity. Personally, the most memorable part of BRLC was watching my students display the virtue of enthusiasm when they cheered excitedly for all the prize winners from junior primary.”</p>
<p>Mr Zaini’s words echoed our thoughts, “BRLC Celebrates! was the icing on the cake on all the big events happening in our school. It was really a celebration that encompassed all parties - students, teachers &amp; non-teaching staff. The classroom decor activity lifted the celebratory atmosphere even higher. What a way to end the year! Truly explosive!”</p>
<p>Despite this being yet another unusual and challenging year, we were glad to be able to celebrate our spirit of learning and growing as a community. Through this event, we affirmed the achievements and resilience of our students and staff. Well done to all!</p>
<p>We look forward to a better 2022!</p>
