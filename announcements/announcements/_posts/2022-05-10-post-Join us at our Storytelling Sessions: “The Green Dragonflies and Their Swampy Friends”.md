<p><em>In Telok Blangah Hill Park there lives a family of dragonflies. Due to climate change, the dragonflies&rsquo; water source dries up. The family leaves in search for a new home. They come across Berlayer Creek and meet new friends who help them adapt to the new surroundings. What adventures will they come across in their new home?</em></p>
<p>"The Green Dragonflies and their Swampy Friends" is an illustrated children's book written and illustrated by BRPS&rsquo;s very own. The book tells a tale of a group of Dragonflies who are displaced from their home and are in search of a new one.</p>
<p>Join us for our storytelling sessions to learn more about dragonflies and climate change! Suitable for children ages 10 and below.</p>
