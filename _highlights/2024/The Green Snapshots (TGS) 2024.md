<h4>The Green Snapshots (TGS) 2024</h4>
<p>In its 10th edition this year, The Green Snapshots (TGS) continues to
be a standout initiative that started in 2015 as part of Singapore’s Jubilee
Celebrations. TGS provides unique opportunities for both the school and
external communities to appreciate the rich, green history of Telok Blangah
and the Southern Ridges. Leveraging on the school’s environmental education
programme, this trail seamlessly integrates nature into the curriculum,
offering purposeful and fun experiential learning activities.</p>
<p>At this year’s public trail, our student-docents led participants on a
guided walk around Telok Blangah Hill Park, Labrador Park and Mount Faber.
The participants were engaged in hands-on activities and a STEM challenge
that were included in the TGS Activity Booklet.</p>

<p>Student-docents also delved into the historical aspects of Telok Blangah,
tracing its origins back to the early 19th century. These stories of the
past enriched the experience, fostering a deeper appreciation of Singapore's
history and its ongoing environmental efforts.</p>
<p>Kai Xiang, a student-docent from Primary 5 Topaz, reflected, “This is
my second time taking part in TGS. I am definitely more confident when
presenting and interacting with the public. I could see that the participants
enjoyed themselves, especially during the hands-on session where they created
art pieces using wilted leaves of different shapes and sizes.”</p>
<p>Zheng Hong from Primary 4 Opal shared that he was initially feeling nervous
about presenting to the public. However, after several rounds of practice,
he gained confidence and enjoyed the session as he was able to share new
information to the participants.</p>

<p>Similarly, student-docent Deeksha, from Primary 4 Sapphire, was grateful
for the leadership opportunity. “There were many lines to be memorised
for TGS. However, I definitely had fun as I learnt new things about the
area. I really hope to take part in TGS again next year!”</p>

<p>Once again, TGS attracted the praises of the participating families and
gave rave reviews of our student-docents as they were impressed by their
confidence and engagement.</p>
<p>Indeed, TGS 2024 was a resounding success, and we look forward to its
11th edition next year!</p>
