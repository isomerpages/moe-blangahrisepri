<p>&ldquo;We are going to go to the Computer Lab today!&rdquo; It is the students&rsquo; weekly lesson in the computer lab and they got ready excitedly. Teachers engage the students in blended learning whereby they have the opportunity to learn at their own pace and discover new knowledge. In addition, students extend their learning through collaboration with their peers and share ideas to gain new perspectives in online activities. As learning can take place anytime and anywhere, students are able to access the learning materials from home too.</p>
<p><strong>Effectiveness of ICT-based lessons</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;ICT tools have value added students&rsquo; learning because it help to make our lessons more interactive and engaging. They are able to explore new concepts and discuss with their peers. In addition, we could leverage on the power of technology to provide instant feedback to our students and help them learn better. It also help us to adapt our lessons and strategies to better support our students in learning&rdquo; These are some of the thoughts expressed by our teachers. Technology boots active learning, creating a participatory, connected, and reflective classroom which nurtures the future-ready learners.</p>
<p><strong>Physical and Digital Spaces: Transforming the way students learn<br /></strong>From our Full Home-Based Learning experience, our students have developed the confidence to learn with technology in different learning contexts, with teachers blending learning seamlessly in both face-to-face and online spaces. Students shared that they were more confident in raising questions and building on their knowledge through online discussions.</p>
<p>Learning can indeed take place anytime and anywhere as students shared that they were very happy to see their teachers and peers online and learn from one another. &ldquo;The Zoom lesson was an extension to what my students had learnt from the lesson in Student Learning Space. The students drew the shapes that they had learnt from the lesson, applied and extended knowledge gleaned by using Mathematical language to describe them. This provided me with feedback on my students&rsquo; level of understanding and ability to apply knowledge in a context,&rdquo; said Mrs Tay, a Math teacher.</p>

<p><strong>Building up ICT skills proficiency<br /></strong>In order for students to be confident in harnessing technology for learning, they acquire ICT skills through an enrichment programme. The skills are aligned to the MOE ICT Baseline standards and are integrated into the curriculum. Our Primary 1 students are introduced to PC Literacy and touch-typing so as to build up their mastery of navigation in the cyber world. As our students build confidence in harnessing technology, we engage our Primary 2 to 6 students in self-directed and collaborative learning through Google Classrooms. &nbsp;At Primary 2, students apply their touchtyping skills and write a short story using Google Documents.</p>
