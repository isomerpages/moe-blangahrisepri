<p>Our Dance Club members train under a team of accomplished and experienced dance instructors. Besides participating in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation (Dance) every two years, we also perform during annual school events and celebrations such as Chinese New Year and BRLC Celebrates!</p>
<p>Besides the sheer joy of dancing, learning dance builds confidence, discipline and relationships. Our members have mastered basic dance moves and developed skills, such as balance, coordination, flexibility and musicality. With months of intensive training and amazing teamwork, we have consistently attained the &ldquo;Accomplishment Award&rdquo; at the bi-annual Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Festival since 2012</p>

<p>Our members have expressed a deep interest in dance. Lee Ning (Primary 6) plans to apply to her choice secondary schools via Direct School Admission (DSA) in the talent area of dance. She reflected, &ldquo;I enjoy dancing as I&rsquo;m able to express myself through movement. I can also relieve stress while doing what I love. Dance has helped me to build confidence as I perform to an audience. It is my aspiration to further my training in dance in my secondary school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Singapore moves towards a Covid-19 endemic status, Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) resumed with relevant safe management measure in place. In anticipation of the SYF Arts Presentation (Dance) 2022 that will be held in July, our dancers have been putting extra hours to practice and rehearse for their performance. Cheryl Lei (Primary 4) shared,&rdquo; This is my first time participating in SYF. I feel nervous dancing before an audience, but at the same time I am also excited that I am can dance on stage for the first time in my life.&rdquo;</p>
