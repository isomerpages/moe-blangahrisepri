A tree offers shelter with its leaves, sweet fragrances from its flowers, fruits to eat, and a relaxed space to gather. On its own, a tree cannot build a consistent local climate. But together, many trees create an ecosystem that moderates the temperature, stores more water, and generates the needed humidity. As a community, we can achieve that which cannot be done by separate individuals.

To create the type of school environment that nurtures community and togetherness, students’ works are designed on the walls, decoration trees, class notice boards, level boards. Student Leaders regularly share and encourage each other through sharing of motivational quotes and stories before the singing of the National Anthem and via various level notice and walkway boards, staircases, Art & NE Heritage Galleries.

To monitor and nurture students’ growth in the Virtues and 7 Habits, there are multiple recognition schemes that emphasize and encourage students to practice them.

In Blangah Rise, all our students are precious gems whom we lovingly polish so that they can shine and be the best they can be. The termly GEM Class award acknowledges students who work cooperatively and exemplify the Seven Habits and the underlying virtues as a class. The termly GEM Student award recognises students from every level who display the Seven Habits and the virtues in their everyday actions.

Students contribute to the caring and positive peer culture in school when they look out for one another, provide support to their peers in need and build positive relationships with one another. Good stories are also collated to inspire our students to learn from these exemplary behaviours.
