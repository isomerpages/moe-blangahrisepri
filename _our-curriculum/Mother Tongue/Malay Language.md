<h4><strong>Description of Programmes:</strong></h4>
<p><strong><em>Teaching &amp; Learning<br></em></strong>In our Malay Language classes, a variety of strategies are adopted to enhance our students’ learning and to provide them with opportunities to demonstrate thinking and communication skills. Students not only learn through textbooks but also through experiential learning to make learning meaningful for students. 

For instance, infusing Malay Literature elements like pantun, puisi, and cerpen helps our students understand the language better and learn about Malay culture. Students appreciate the language and culture. We hope our students will love both the language and the culture, and become excited about sharing their joy of learning the Malay Language with others.

<p>Besides that, ICT-based lessons using ICT tools and apps are designed not only to bring fun and excitement to the learning of the language, but they also value-add to students’ learning process. 

Kashia (6 Sapphire) shared, “The use of Nearpod has helped me to identify my learning gaps as my teacher can provide feedback to me immediately.”
Fuadah (4 Sapphire) added, “I enjoyed doing my work through Google Classroom because I can add image to my slides and I can work independently.”

<p><strong><em>Inquiry-Based Learning<br></em></strong>Through Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL), our students engage in self-directed and collaborative learning. IBL, paired with authentic learning, promotes critical and inventive thinking skills in our students as they attempt to solve real-world problems. For instance, the Primary 5 students designed their version of batik and even researched about origins of batik.</p>
