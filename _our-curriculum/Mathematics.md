<p>The central focus of the framework is mathematical problem solving, that is, using mathematics to solve problems. The framework stresses conceptual understanding, skills proficiency and mathematical processes, and gives due emphasis to attitudes and metacognition. These five components are inter-related.</p>
<p><strong>Approach<br /></strong>We believe that all students can learn and want to learn mathematics. We create opportunities for all students to be actively engaged in learning Mathematics. We foster positive attitudes in students towards Mathematics and make learning fun and meaningful through a variety of learning experiences.</p>

<p>As explained by Ms Eileen Puah, Head of Department for Mathematics, &ldquo;We have shopping time in class and learning journeys to help our students relate Mathematics to everyday life. We use manipulatives such as fraction discs and place value cards to help our students understand concepts better.&rdquo;</p>
