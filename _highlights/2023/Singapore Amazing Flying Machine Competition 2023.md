<p>Our P4 students represented our school by taking part in the annual Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition on 20 March. This competition is organised by DSO National Laboratories and Science Centre Singapore to encourage students to learn more about the theories of flight and aerodynamics, and implement their creative ideas into real flying machines. Prior to the competition, the students had spent weeks researching and testing their model planes to fulfil the requirements. Batrisya exclaimed, “I had learnt how to fold a boomerang that worked!” “I learned more about aerodynamics principles like drag and thrust, and how to apply them to make planes go further,” Marvell shared. For Thanushraj, he felt that the most important lesson for him is knowing what resilience means. “We will keep trying again and again so that our team can win next year,” he said.</p>
