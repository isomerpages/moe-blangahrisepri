<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>WE&nbsp;<em>LEARN</em>&nbsp;AS ONE<br></strong><strong>WE&nbsp;<em>PLAY</em>&nbsp;AS ONE<br></strong><strong>WE&nbsp;<em>SUCCEED</em>&nbsp;AS ONE</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Note to Parents<br></strong>
</p><p>Welcome to the Senior Primary webpage! We are excited to share valuable tips to support your child's success at school. Here are some practical suggestions for maximizing your child's potential during lessons:</p>
<p>1. Prioritise Ample Rest:
Ensure that your child gets enough rest the night before a school day. A good night's sleep enhances concentration and reduces the likelihood of missing important concepts in class. Encourage a consistent bedtime routine to help your child wake up refreshed and ready for the new day.</p>
<p>2.	Promote Proactivity:
Teach your child the importance of being proactive in preparing for school. Remind them to pack their schoolbag daily with the necessary stationery and books. This habit not only fosters responsibility but also ensures that your child is well-prepared for lessons. Emphasize the importance of keeping the school bag reasonably light to prevent unnecessary strain.</p>
<p>3.	Complete Homework and Revision: 
Support your child in completing all assigned homework and revision stated in their diary before bedtime. This practice not only reinforces the concepts learned in class but also allows teachers to address any learning gaps or misconceptions. By establishing a routine of completing school work at home, your child will develop strong study habits.</p>
<p>By working together, we can make a positive impact on your child's holistic development and help them achieve their fullest potential. We look forward to partnering with you in fostering a supportive and enriching learning environment. Feel free to stay updated on our webpage for upcoming activities and events in the Senior Primary level. Thank you for your commitment to your child’s education!</p>

<p><strong>P5 Code for Fun Programme<br></strong>Look at the glow on our Primary 5 pupils’ faces upon witnessing their own Sphero Bolts spinning and lighting up according to their programming! Today, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become commonplace in daily lives. Hence, in BRPS, we see the need to expose our students to basic programming and coding skills.</p>
<p>In Term 2, our Primary 5 students went through a series of workshops where they learnt Computational Thinking through basic coding. In this enrichment class, students learn computational thinking and making, and are exposed to coding concepts through a blend of software input (visual/syntax-based programming language) and hardware output (Robotics and Microcontrollers). They even made use of their newly found skills to play traditional game like ‘Scissors, Paper, Stones’ with one another! Let’s hear what our students thought of this programme:</p>
<p>“I enjoyed the program very much. I learnt how to code the Sphero, make it light up with different flash lights and control its movement. I think that learning coding will make our lives easier in the future!”&nbsp;<em>(Rian Hong, 5 Topaz)</em></p>
<p>“I had so much fun! I was able to control the robot’s movement. I hope that in the future I am able to program robots to help my family with housework!” <em>(Lin Zesheng, 5 Topaz)</em></p>
<p>“It was fun and engaging! I get to play with robots and I learnt how to programme them. I aspire to be a game developer when I grow up!”&nbsp;<em>(Tam Chi Fung, 5 Sapphire)</em></p>

</p><p><strong>TSR Time in Senior Primary<br></strong>Teachers and students start a typical school day right by engaging in fun filled activities as well as meaningful conversations. During TSR time, teachers not only take the opportunity to bond with their students, they also create opportunities for students to build camaraderie amongst themselves. Teachers highlight positive behaviour displayed by pupils and affirmed their actions through a mixture of fun activities and conversations during this time.
‘TSR time is a great way to build meaningful relationships with my students. I am able to strengthen my bond with my class before the lesson and am able to interact freely with them. Most of all, it starts the day on a chirpy and engaging tone that keeps them motivated for the day’, quoted Ms Munirah!

<p><strong>P6 Bonding Camp<br></strong></p>
<p>Our annual Primary 6 Bonding Camp commenced on 26 March 2024 under the inspiring theme, “We Can’t, We Can, We Will”. The camp aimed to enhance students' spirits through a blend of enjoyable and challenging activities, fostering enduring memories and a profound sense of belonging, confidence, and camaraderie among peers.</p>
<p>Throughout the first day of camp, students embodied the habit of think win-win as they embraced healthy competition while maintaining a supportive and collaborative atmosphere. They were engaged in various team-building endeavors, honing effective communication and trust-building skills to conquer shared challenges across different stations. Students pushed their boundaries while relying on strong bonds to overcome obstacles and innovate problem-solving strategies to achieve a common shared goal.</p>
<p>The camp also served as a platform for breaking down barriers, uniting students from different classes to promote inclusivity and mutual respect as they had to seek first to understand, then to be understood. Cheryl and Li Ting from 6 Sapphire shared, “The camp was awesome! We played in many fun activities with our friends from both the classes. We had to work together to finish the activities as a team. It was tough at first as we were not familiar with some of them, but we all helped one another out and at the end, we became friends”.</p>
<p>On the second day, students engaged in a collaborative initiative with JA Singapore, focusing on real-world skills and career readiness through an enriching learning journey. Activities were designed to cultivate empathy and awareness of global issues, fostering a deeper appreciation for education and inspiring altruistic action. Through assembling solar-powered lights for distribution in Cambodia, students demonstrated compassion and solidarity, further strengthening their sense of shared purpose and global citizenship. “We synergized with our peers to address global issues and I really enjoyed making a positive impact on the world around me through the thoughtful activity”, said Shahan from 6 Topaz.</p>
<p>Witnessing students' personal growth, enriched relationships, and application of learned habits highlighted the camp's success in nurturing life skills and forging enduring friendships that will support our students in their journey even after they leave the school.</p>

<p><strong>A glimpse into our Primary 5 and 6 classrooms<br></strong>A large amount of the student’s time is spent sitting in a classroom. It is important to make this learning space vibrant and inviting so that learning can take place in a comfortable and safe environment.</p>
<p>Our students and teachers take ownership of the classrooms that they used. They worked together to decorate and put up posters/notices in their classes. Let’s take a peek into the classrooms in the Senior Primary.&nbsp;</p>
