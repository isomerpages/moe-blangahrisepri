<p>Wunna, an international student in Primary 4, left Gardens by the Bay with a newfound appreciation for Singapore.&nbsp;“Our facilitator told us that everything has a way to be small, but still big. I think this applies to Singapore. The total land area of Singapore is small, but we have advanced technologies here! Singapore is such a cool country!”</p>
<p>The visit to&nbsp;Gardens by the Bay on 7 November 2019&nbsp;was&nbsp;part of&nbsp;our&nbsp;school’s International Students&nbsp;and Permanent Residents&nbsp;(ISPR) programme.&nbsp;This programme aims to&nbsp;help&nbsp;our international students&nbsp;adjust to our national&nbsp;school&nbsp;setting&nbsp;and&nbsp;gain a deeper&nbsp;understanding of&nbsp;Singapore. It also facilitates&nbsp;the formation of friendships and shared experiences&nbsp;between our&nbsp;local and international students.</p>
<p>The visit to this world-class attraction of Singapore gave&nbsp;our&nbsp;International Students&nbsp;and Permanent Resident&nbsp;students&nbsp;as well as their local buddies&nbsp;a chance to learn about the advanced technologies introduced at Gardens by the Bay&nbsp;and&nbsp;appreciate our natural heritage. As the Gardens by the Bay displayed&nbsp;plants from all over the world, it provided a good opportunity for our students to&nbsp;see&nbsp;Singapore&nbsp;as a global city. This&nbsp;helped&nbsp;our students&nbsp;to&nbsp;feel proud of&nbsp;Singapore’s achievements&nbsp;and nurtured&nbsp;in them&nbsp;a sense of belonging to Singapore.</p>
