<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>WE&nbsp;<em>LEARN</em>&nbsp;AS ONE<br></strong><strong>WE&nbsp;<em>PLAY</em>&nbsp;AS ONE<br></strong><strong>WE&nbsp;<em>SUCCEED</em>&nbsp;AS ONE</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Note to Parents<br></strong>
</p><p>Welcome to the Senior Primary webpage! We are excited to share valuable tips to support your child's success at school. Here are some practical suggestions for maximizing your child's potential during lessons:</p>
<p>1. Prioritise Ample Rest:
Ensure that your child gets enough rest the night before a school day. A good night's sleep enhances concentration and reduces the likelihood of missing important concepts in class. Encourage a consistent bedtime routine to help your child wake up refreshed and ready for the new day.</p>
<p>2.	Promote Proactivity:
Teach your child the importance of being proactive in preparing for school. Remind them to pack their schoolbag daily with the necessary stationery and books. This habit not only fosters responsibility but also ensures that your child is well-prepared for lessons. Emphasize the importance of keeping the school bag reasonably light to prevent unnecessary strain.</p>
<p>3.	Complete Homework and Revision: 
Support your child in completing all assigned homework and revision stated in their diary before bedtime. This practice not only reinforces the concepts learned in class but also allows teachers to address any learning gaps or misconceptions. By establishing a routine of completing school work at home, your child will develop strong study habits.</p>
<p>By working together, we can make a positive impact on your child's holistic development and help them achieve their fullest potential. We look forward to partnering with you in fostering a supportive and enriching learning environment. Feel free to stay updated on our webpage for upcoming activities and events in the Senior Primary level. Thank you for your commitment to your child’s education!</p>

<p><strong>P5 Code for Fun Programme<br></strong>Look at the glow on our Primary 5 pupils’ faces upon witnessing their own Sphero Bolts spinning and lighting up according to their programming! Today, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become commonplace in daily lives. Hence, in BRPS, we see the need to expose our students to basic programming and coding skills.</p>
<p>In Term 2, our Primary 5 students went through a series of workshops where they learnt Computational Thinking through basic coding. In this enrichment class, students learn computational thinking and making, and are exposed to coding concepts through a blend of software input (visual/syntax-based programming language) and hardware output (Robotics and Microcontrollers). They even made use of their newly found skills to play traditional game like ‘Scissors, Paper, Stones’ with one another! Let’s hear what our students thought of this programme:</p>
<p>“I enjoyed the program very much. I learnt how to code the Sphero, make it light up with different flash lights and control its movement. I think that learning coding will make our lives easier in the future!”&nbsp;<em>(Rian Hong, 5 Topaz)</em></p>
<p>“I had so much fun! I was able to control the robot’s movement. I hope that in the future I am able to program robots to help my family with housework!” <em>(Lin Zesheng, 5 Topaz)</em></p>
<p>“It was fun and engaging! I get to play with robots and I learnt how to programme them. I aspire to be a game developer when I grow up!”&nbsp;<em>(Tam Chi Fung, 5 Sapphire)</em></p>

</p><p><strong>TSR Time in Senior Primary<br></strong>Teachers and students start a typical school day right by engaging in fun filled activities as well as meaningful conversations. During TSR time, teachers not only take the opportunity to bond with their students, they also create opportunities for students to build camaraderie amongst themselves. Teachers highlight positive behaviour displayed by pupils and affirmed their actions through a mixture of fun activities and conversations during this time.
‘TSR time is a great way to build meaningful relationships with my students. I am able to strengthen my bond with my class before the lesson and am able to interact freely with them. Most of all, it starts the day on a chirpy and engaging tone that keeps them motivated for the day’, quoted Ms Munirah!

<p><strong>P6 Motivation Camp<br></strong></p>
<p>Our annual Primary 6 Motivation camp kicked off on 21 March 2023 with the theme, “I Can’t, I Can, I Will”. The camp aimed not only to provide opportunities for the students to build camaraderie among one another, it was also designed to incorporate activities that would help build confidence.</p>
<p>On the first day of the camp, our students worked in their groups and used the concepts they learnt in their Science lessons to build a solar oven made of recycled materials. At the end of the project, they tested out their solar oven and even managed to melt some chocolate that they dipped with marshmallow. “I enjoyed the making of the solar oven! I was able to put my knowledge on Materials into good use in this experiment. The best thing is I was able to melt the chocolate and enjoy the marsh mallow candies at the end of the experiment.” shared Lucas from Primary 6 Sapphire.</p>
<p>On the second day of the camp, our students continued to challenge themselves and worked together to overcome many challenges in five different stations. The theme, “Reach For Your Goal”, put their teamwork skills to a test as they overcame challenges encountered in the five stations located around the school compound. The students relied on their strong bonds with their friends to overcome potential obstacles, even as the tasks provided opportunities for students to solve problems creatively.</p>
<p>It was heartening to see the students demonstrating virtues learnt throughout the camp! These are life skills that they would take them a long way even as they leave our gates.</p>

<p><strong>A glimpse into our Primary 5 and 6 classrooms<br></strong>A large amount of the student’s time is spent sitting in a classroom. It is important to make this learning space vibrant and inviting so that learning can take place in a comfortable and safe environment.</p>
<p>Our students and teachers take ownership of the classrooms that they used. They worked together to decorate and put up posters/notices in their classes. Let’s take a peek into the classrooms in the Senior Primary.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Inter-House Games </strong></p>
<p>Experience the excitement of our Interhouse games on the final day of the term! Students came together in their respective houses for a thrilling round of floorball. It was heartening to witness the heartwarming sight of students showcasing sportsmanship and enthusiastically cheering each other on throughout the game.</p>
