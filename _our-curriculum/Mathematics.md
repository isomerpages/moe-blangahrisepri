<p><strong>Vision:<br></strong>Creative and confident problem solvers who have a passion for Mathematics</p>
<p><strong>Mission:<br></strong>To develop reasoning, thinking skills and problem solving skills in every child</p>
<p><strong>MOE Mathematics Framework:</strong></p>
<img src="/images/Math-Framework.png">
<p>The central focus of the framework is mathematical problem solving, that is, using mathematics to solve problems. The framework stresses conceptual understanding, skills proficiency and mathematical processes, and gives due emphasis to attitudes and metacognition. These five components are inter-related.</p>
<p><strong>Approach<br></strong>We believe that all students can learn and want to learn mathematics. We create opportunities for all students to be actively engaged in learning Mathematics. We foster positive attitudes in students towards Mathematics and make learning fun and meaningful through a variety of learning experiences. </p>

<p>As explained by Ms Eileen Puah, Head of Department for Mathematics, “We have shopping time in class and learning journeys to help our students relate Mathematics to everyday life. We use a variety of manipulatives such as fraction discs and place value cards to help our students understand concepts better.”</p>

</p><p><strong>Description of programmes:<br></strong><strong>E2K Mathematics Programme</strong></p>
<p><em>How do we deepen our students’ learning in Mathematics?</em></p>
<p>Our students in the&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>ccelerated&nbsp;<strong>P</strong>rogramme to&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>nhance students’ e<strong>X</strong>perience (APEX) attend the E2K Mathematics Programme. The materials are taken from the MOE Gifted Education Branch. We aim to develop students’ mathematical reasoning skills and deepen their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach.</p>
<p> Kai Xiang, a Primary 4 student in APEX, shared, “We look forward to every lesson as we get to solve challenging puzzles. We are happy to work with our friends to discuss and solve them. We present our solutions to our teachers and friends so that they can help us improve.”</p><p>
	
</p><p><strong>LEGO Building<br>
	
</strong></p><p><strong>The creative process of building with lego engages students in a hands-on and interactive experience that promote mathematical thinking.  The construction of lego objects involves problem-solving skills as students plan and analyse the pieces they have, envision the desired outcome and figure out required steps to achieve it. They develop spatial and pattern reasoning ability as they visualize how different pieces fit together.</strong></p><strong>

<p><strong>Mathematics Olympiad<br></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Mathematics Olympiad workshops are organised for Primary 4 to 6 students who are keen to enrich and enhance their learning in Mathematics. Students who perform well are selected to represent the school in external competitions such as the National Mathematical Olympiad of Singapore (NMOS) and the Singapore Mathematical Olympiad for Primary Schools (SMOPS).</strong></p><strong>
<p>Rian, a Primary 6 student who had taken part in the annual Mathlympics competition, said, “We ask questions to help us understand the questions better. We persevere in our efforts to solve the questions.”</p>
<p><strong>Use of ICT<br></strong>To motivate and engage our students in learning, ICT is infused into Mathematics lessons. Students use the ‘See, Think, Wonder’ thinking routine to apply the mathematical concepts they have learnt to real-life situations. The Student Learning Space (SLS) and ICT tools (such as Microsoft Excel and GeoGebra) provide opportunities for students to work collaboratively, deepen their understanding and be self-directed learners.</p>

<p><strong>BRPS Math Challenge<br></strong>Students have the opportunities to take part in challenging, fun and engaging math challenge activities every term. These activities include magic number, sudoku, secret codes and multiplication tables. 

Students build confidence and resilience as they persist and persevere to solve problems. The results are displayed on the level board to celebrate students’ success. Learning is made joyful and enriching for students. </p>

The objectives of Math Challenge are as follows:

	•	Enhance mathematical knowledge and skills - students deeepen their understanding of various mathematical topics and improve their mathematical fluency

	•	Promote mathematical skills - students think critically and creatively to solve the problems

	•	Inspire interest in mathematics - spark enthusiasm and curiosity in students

<p><strong>Math Star Award</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Hard work&nbsp;</em><em>&nbsp;Perseverance = Success</em></strong></p>
<p>The Math Star Award recognizes students who have exhibited proficiency and shown exceptional potential in mastering mathematics. The award nurtures a sense of pride and encouragement in learning mathematics. Students are inspired and motivated to pursue excellence in mathematics.
 “I am delighted to win the Math Star Award this term. I will continue to do my best in math. I hope to win the award next term again,” says Zheng Hao, a Primary 5 student, proudly.

<p><strong>Fun with Math Programme<br>
	The Parent Support Group (PSG) works collaboratively with the school to enhance the learning experience and academic success of students. Students are engaged in math games and a variety of activities that include story-telling to build students’ factual fluency and foster interest in learning math.
“I look forward to the Fun with Math programme. I used to think math is difficult. Now I think I can do the math questions and I want to do more, says Cindy, a Primary 2 student.

</strong></p><p><strong><strong>STEM Programme - ALP<br></strong>This programme aims to leverage on STEM to create more meaningful and engaging activities that integrate engineering and technology in Mathematics and Science to fuel students’ enthusiasm in learning as well as to promote 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century skills – critical thinking, decision-making, collaboration, communication and creativity. It provides students with opportunities to innovate and apply content knowledge to bridge the gap between key theoretical concepts and real-world applications.</strong></p><strong>
