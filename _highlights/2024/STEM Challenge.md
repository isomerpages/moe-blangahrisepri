<p>The recent STEM Challenge, organized by Science Centre Singapore in partnership
with the James Dyson Foundation, tasked students from Primary 3 to 6 with
constructing cotton reel tanks propelled by simple materials. The challenge
emphasized the concept of energy conversion, and over 75% of participants
successfully completed the challenge. Congratulations to these young engineers
for demonstrating their problem-solving abilities and application of scientific
principles! #STEMSG #STEMPLAYGROUND #brpsalp</p>
