<h4><strong>Photo Appreciation</strong></h4>
<p>“What story does this photograph tell us?”</p>
<p>This is one of the questions our Primary 2 and 3 students think about
and share their ideas with their peers. They observe, analyse photographs
and share their stories with their peers. Through this activity, our students
have the opportunity to develop observational, creativity and critical
thinking skills.</p>

<p>Students also get to learn about composition techniques which they could
leverage to tell a more interesting story. They get to apply their learning
through hands-on activities and analysing photographs taken by their peers
at our photo gallery, Rising Expressions.</p>
<h4><strong>Learning Through Photography</strong></h4>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

<p>In Young Photographers, students leverage the power of photography to
achieve the 3Cs – Create, Communicate and Collaborate.</p>
<p>To capture photographs that tell a story or a concept, students acquire
photography skills and composition techniques such as rule of thirds, leading
lines, layering, framing and symmetry. Students acquire these composition
techniques and outdoor shoot locations through Student Learning Space (SLS).
This provides them with opportunities to be an active and self-directed
learner</p>
<p>All students attend face to face sessions and outdoor shoots in Young
Photographers, which equip them with valuable skills to create and communicate
stories through their lenses using DSLR cameras.</p>
<h4><strong>Learning beyond the classrooms</strong></h4>
<p>The Primary 4 students have been given a task – they need to apply photography
skills to capture flowers with bright coloured petals, leaves with different
edges and shapes. What did they use? A DSLR camera and knowledge on plants
gleaned from their Science lessons.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

<p></p>
<p>They learnt composition techniques such as layering and leading lines
using the DSLR camera and applied their skills at Gardens by The Bay –
Flower Dome. They were able to observe the different colours and shapes
of flowers and plants in real life as compared to images found in textbooks
and videos.</p>
<p>Ka Shing said, “I had learnt about plants during Science lessons in school
and Student Learning Space (SLS). Learning was more exciting when I observed
the plants at Flower Dome in real. I applied my knowledge from Science
and took photographs of leaves with different edges.”</p>
<p>Dave shared, “Young Photographers was very enjoyable and interactive.
It was my first time using a DSLR! I learnt new composition techniques
such as layering and framing. We saw and learnt about some exotic flowers
and plants which we had never seen before.”</p>

<p>Our Primary 5 students went to Marina Barrage for their outdoor shoot.
They had learnt about the threefold benefits of the location and its importance
to Singapore. Just like the other levels, they applied photography skills
gleaned to capture the beauty of Marina Barrage.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Practice is Key</strong></h4>
<p>Students are given the opportunity to apply and practise photography skills
through outdoor shoots at Telok Blangah Heights, Singapore Botanic Gardens,
Gardens by the Bay – Flower Dome, Marina Barrage and Jurong Lake Gardens.
They capture images based on the theme for each level. While doing so,
students’ confidence in handling the cameras grows.</p>

<p>After the outdoor shoots, students share compelling stories and perspectives
through their own photographs. There are many enriching learning opportunities.
Our Primary 4 to Primary 6 students hone their English Language skills
through photojournalism via our &nbsp;<a href="/viewpoints/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Viewpoints</a> programme. This activity provides enriching
learning opportunities by encouraging students to become active contributors
and collaborate with one another.</p>

<h4><strong>Think Beyond What We See</strong></h4>
<p>Using the Thinking Routine See-Think-Wonder in SLS, students analyse photographs
so as to generate possibilities, deepen their thinking and raise questions.
Jayden, a P3 student, says “We have learnt to be more imaginative, explore
different ideas and ask questions through See-Think-Wonder. We were then
able to view things from different angles and apply our photography skills
at the outdoor shoots.”</p>
