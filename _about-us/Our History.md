<p>Blangah Rise Primary school was established in 25 April 1977 in Telok
Blangah Rise. In 1999, as the estate matured, 284 students from the former
Jagoh Primary joined the school. In 2000, BRPS shifted to its present building
with better facilities in Telok Blangah Heights and became a single session
school. The school underwent the Single-Session Primary School (SSPS) Upgrading
Project and is now equipped with an indoor Sports Hall, Programme for Active
(PAL) rooms, a Teaching Lab as well as a Student Care Centre (SCC) that
were completed at the end of 2012. In 2014, the school was one of the 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;phase
schools hosting MOE Kindergartens. The MOE Kindergarten became part of
the school in 2018.</p>
