<p>Join us in this year’s special Bicentennial Edition of our nature and heritage trail, The Green Snapshots!</p>
<p>The trail&nbsp;is a learning journey to appreciate the rich and&nbsp;green&nbsp;heritage of Telok Blangah District and Mount Faber. It is built on the school’s Learning for Life (LLP) Environmental Education programme, which weaves nature into the curriculum and provides experiential learning activities for our students.</p>
<p>As part of the guided-trail version, our student-docents will provide an in-depth and personal sharing of the history and flora &amp; fauna of Telok Blangah and the Southern Ridges.&nbsp;During the 2½-hour long guided tours, they will also share about the area’s unique architecture and development over the years. In addition, our student-docents will engage participants in hands-on activities.</p>
<p>Bring along your family and friends and join us for a walk along the green corridor!</p>
