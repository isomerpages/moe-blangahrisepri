<h4>International Partnerships</h4>
<p>Our Primary 5 students had an exciting day as they hosted students from
Pat Heung Primary School, Hong Kong. Despite meeting for the first time,
the students from both countries connected well and collaborated on a STEM
activity. They worked together to build a parachute that could stay in
the air as long as possible.</p>

<p>"Working on the STEM activity with my new friend, Brenmma, was amazing!
We combined our ideas, learnt from each other, and had so much fun! It
was great to see how different perspectives can come together to create
something awesome. It made me appreciate teamwork more!" reflected Japheth
from 5 Topaz.</p>

<p>The students also spent their recess together. "During recess, I sat next
to Wafa. It was amazing to hear him talk about his life in Hong Kong. He
told me about the different food they eat, the festivals they celebrate,
and how different the schools in Hong Kong are. It was fun learning new
things and making new friends. It showed me how big and interesting the
world is!" said Felisha from 5 Topaz.</p>
<p>This meaningful collaboration fostered teamwork and creativity, demonstrating
the power of cross-cultural exchange in education.</p>
