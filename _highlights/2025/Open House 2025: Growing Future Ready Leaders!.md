<p>“Do you have music lessons?”</p>
<p>“How long is recess?”</p>
<p>“What happens if you lose your belongings?”</p>
<p>These were just some of the burning questions from our curious preschool
visitors during the Student Dialogue at our Open House on 5 July! Blangah
Rise Primary School was buzzing with energy as we welcomed prospective
students and parents to explore what makes our school so special.</p>
<p>From the Inspire Hub in the hall to the Voices Exchange in the library,
the entire school came alive across four exciting zones. Visitors enjoyed
toe-tapping performances by our Choir and Dancers, explored our Character
&amp; Citizenship Education (CCE) and STEM showcases, trying their hand
at flying some drones.</p>
<p>Our student debaters sparked lively discussion with a mock debate, while
our storytellers brought our very own published book, <em>Friends of Berlayer Creek: The Last Garden</em>,
to life. At the Ask Me Anything (AMA) segment, our school leaders bravely
took on questions live from the crowd—no topic was off-limits!</p>
<p>And of course, what’s a school experience without some hands-on fun? Little
hands got creative with art fringe activities and musical play at our mini
library, while parents chatted with teachers about our curriculum and programmes.</p>
<p>It was a day of laughter, learning and connection. We hope our guests
left feeling inspired and excited to join the Blangah Rise family!</p>
