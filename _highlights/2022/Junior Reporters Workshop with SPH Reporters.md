<p>Do you know what constitutes to a good news report? Our Junior Reporters learnt that it must be recent, impactful, special, controversial and at times related to famous people. They had a better understanding on crafting news-worthy articles during the Junior Reporters Workshop conducted by Miss Xie Shangyi and Miss Tan Hui Ting, Journalists cum Sub Editor from SPH Media Trust Young Audience.</p>
