<p>On 28 May 2022, the school held its first physical Open House since 2020. This year, the theme of the Open House was the BRPS Green Fiesta. The Open House showcased the school’s efforts in environmental education and holistic curriculum.</p>
<p>To kick off the open house, three green learning areas were officially opened by the invited guests. First, The Garden of Hope, an urban garden which harvests rainwater for irrigation, was opened officially by the Parents Support Group. Then, a tree planting ceremony with the School Advisory Council was held at the Bamboo Terrace, where the bamboo trees signify the growth mindset that both teachers and students should have. Finally, The Biodiversity Corridor, which helps students to learn more about flora and fauna through display corners and themed gardens surrounding the classrooms, was officially opened by the Alumni. After 2 years of social distancing, we were thrilled to open our gates and involved our stakeholders to inaugurate these green learning spaces.</p>
<p>There was a buzz of excitement in the air as preschoolers and their families were invited to participate in various educational activities, such as storytelling sessions in both English and Chinese, guided tours around the gardens, the Primary 1 classroom experience, coding and STEM activities, nutrition talks, sports and games and many more. Our newly published book “The Green Dragonflies and Their Swampy Friends” even made an appearance at the school library, as many preschoolers were delighted to hear their story and try their hand at crafting their own dragonflies. It was indeed an exciting day as pre-school students and our Blangahnites explored what the school had to offer during the Open House!</p>
