<p>“Selemat Tengah Hari, Cikgu Azlin!”<br>“郭老师午安！”</p>
<p>These would have been typical greetings, except that they were uttered by Primary 3 and Primary 4 students who were learning Chinese and Malay for the first time.</p>
<p>Our students had the opportunity to learn a different Mother Tongue Language during the Conversational Chinese and Conversational Malay (CCM) Programme on the 11 March. In our multiracial society, learning a different language will help our students to interact with friends of different races in the community. They will also better understand and appreciate their friends’ culture and values. When they are older, it will help them to engage their counterparts in the region.</p>
<p>“I like CCM lessons because I get to learn a different language,” said Carllh.</p>
<p>Zhi Lin, whose parents speak Malay, exclaimed, “I can finally speak Malay to my parents!”</p>
<p>We can be sure that our students are looking forward to the next few sessions of CCM!</p>
