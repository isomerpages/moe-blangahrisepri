The 6th National Text Recital Competition is jointly organised by the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning (CPCLL), Anderson Primary School, Pei Hwa Presbyterian Primary School and the Singapore Chinese Teachers’ Literary Recital Society. The competition aims to raise students’ Chinese language reading proficiency, ignite their love for learning the language, and deepen their understanding of the Chinese texts in their textbooks.

We are happy to share that 6 of our students, Xie Chengen (2 Sapphire), Leticia Nathania Tjong (2 Sapphire), Ng Ren Jie (2 Topaz), Tan Sin Un (2 Topaz), Kuo Jiu Ting (2 Topaz) and Teo Kai Xiang (4 Topaz) received the certificate of participation. Teo Kai Ting (3 Sapphire) received the Silver award and Walter Siew Hao Zhe (2 Sapphire) received the Bronze award for the competition!

Walter felt very happy as he practiced very hard and worked towards the competition. Sin Un and Ren Jie hoped to get a chance to participate in the competition again next year.

Heartiest congratulations to our students!
