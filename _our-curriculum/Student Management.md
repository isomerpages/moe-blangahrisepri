<p>The school’s character development programme – Leader in Me – centres
on Stephen Covey's Seven Habits of Happy Kids and The Virtues Project.
Through this programme, we instil self-discipline in our students by guiding
them to embody virtues for personal growth and interpersonal effectiveness.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we support the development of students’ social and emotional
skills as well as those with learning and behavioural needs through multi-pronged
values-based approaches. These ensure that our students stay healthy and
positive and are competent and confident to achieve success in school.</p>

<p>In Blangah Rise Primary School, we aim to set the year right by carrying
out the First Days of School Programme. It is an important annual initiative
at our school, where Form Teachers engage students in the new academic
year through various activities. We prioritise student wellness, classroom
management, and fostering positive relationships to cultivate a conducive
learning environment for all.</p>
<p>As part of the First Days of School Programme, students leverage a curated
set of activities to build rapport with their peers and teachers, set goals
and expectations. One of the activities includes the Good Words Campaign
which advocates the use of good and kind words to one another.</p>

<p>To be more purposeful in their planning of activities beyond school hours,
students are also mentored by their teachers to plan a schedule that not
only consists of homework and revisions, but one that also champions good
practice of self-care.</p>
<p><strong>Student Leadership</strong>
</p>
<p>In Blangah Rise Primary School, there are many opportunities for students
to grow as a contributing leader. Within the classrooms, students can be
appointed to be a part of their class committee in roles such as the Class
Monitor and Environment Ambassadors . Students who have consistently demonstrated
exemplary behaviour and practise virtues through their actions and words
serve the school and community through roles such as the Prefects, CCA
Leaders and Level Ambassadors.</p>

<p><strong>School programmes and activities supported by Student Leaders</strong>
</p>
<p>Blangah Rise Primary School nurture future leaders by creating opportunities
to hone their leadership skills through their involvement in key programmes.
Through active participation, student leaders develop confidence, teamwork,
and a sense of responsibility to the school, community and beyond. Some
of the activities supported by our student leaders are as follows:</p>

<p><strong>EAS Day</strong> – The annual event acknowledges, affirms, and
appreciates the work and support of the school’s non-teaching staff. Facilitated

<p><strong>The Green Snapshots (TGS) Nature &amp; Heritage Trail</strong> –
Student-docents are equipped with communication and information skills
as they lead participating members of the public on this award-winning
nature and heritage trail that is built on the school’s <a href="https://blangahrisepri.moe.edu.sg/our-distinctive-programmes/learning-for-life-programme/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Learning for Life (LLP) programme</a>.</p>
<p>The trail weaves nature into the curriculum and provides experiential
learning activities for students and participants. Originally, it was a
learning journey that shared the rich nature and heritage of Telok Blangah
and Mount Faber. Now, the trail includes the unique biodiversity of Labrador
Nature Reserve.</p>
