<p><strong>Vision:<br></strong>Creative and confident problem solvers who have a passion for Mathematics</p>
<p><strong>Mission:<br></strong>To develop reasoning, thinking skills and problem solving skills in every child</p>
<p><strong>MOE Mathematics Framework:</strong></p>
<img style="width: 60%;" src="/images/Math-Framework.png">
<p>The central focus of the framework is mathematical problem solving, that is, using mathematics to solve problems. The framework stresses conceptual understanding, skills proficiency and mathematical processes, and gives due emphasis to attitudes and metacognition. These five components are inter-related.</p>
<p><strong>Approach<br></strong>We believe that all students can learn and want to learn Mathematics. We create opportunities for all students to be actively engaged in learning Mathematics. We foster positive attitudes in students towards Mathematics and make learning fun and meaningful through a variety of learning experiences.
</p>

Manipulatives such as cubes, fractions and place value cards that are used during lessons provide our students with concrete representations of abstract mathematical concepts and thus make the concepts easier to understand.

Additionally, incorporating authentic examples from everyday life make learning of mathematics more relevant and meaningful to students. By connecting mathematical concepts to real-world situations, our students can see how Mathematics is used in their daily lives and understand its practical applications. This approach can also help our students develop problem-solving skills and critical thinking abilities as they apply mathematical concepts and skills to solve real-world problems.

We believe infusing thinking routines and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools into lessons will enhance student engagement and understanding.  
</p>
<p>
For example, the ‘See, Think, Wonder’ Thinking Routine encourages students to observe, analyse, and question real-life situations through the lens of mathematical concepts. By prompting them to "see" what's happening, "think" critically about the mathematical concepts involved, and "wonder" about potential solutions or implications, students develop a deeper understanding of how mathematics applies to the world around them. 
</p>
<p>
The Student Learning Space (SLS) p rovides an online learning platform where students can access learning resources, collaborate with peers, and engage in interactive learning activities. Through SLS, students have the flexibility to explore concepts at their own pace and receive immediate feedback, fostering a more personalised learning experience.

<p></p><p><strong>Deepening our students’ learning in Mathematics<br></strong>
<strong>E2K Mathematics Programme</strong></p>

<p>Our students in the&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>ccelerated&nbsp;<strong>P</strong>rogramme to&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>nhance students’ e<strong>X</strong>perience (APEX) attend the E2K Mathematics Programme. The materials are curated the MOE Gifted Education Branch. We aim to develop students’ mathematical reasoning skills and deepen their conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach.</p>
<p>Kai Xiang, a Primary 5 student in APEX, gave positive feedback about the programme. “We look forward to every lesson as we get to solve challenging puzzles. We are happy to work with our friends to discuss and solve them. We present our solutions to our teachers and friends so that they can help us improve.”</p><p>
	

</p><p><strong>Mathematics Olympiad<br></strong></p><p></p><p>Mathematics Olympiad workshops are organised for selected Primary 4 to 6 students to nurture their interest and talent in Mathematics. Students who demonstrate exceptional performance and dedication can be selected to represent the school in external Mathematics competitions such as Asia-Pacific Mathematical Olympiad for Primary Schools (APMOPS), Raffles Mathematical Olympiad (RMO), Visual Spatial Mathlympics and Annual Mathlympics.</p>



<p><strong>BRPS Math Challenge<br></strong>The BRPS Math Challenge fosters a love of lifelong learning by encouraging the students to explore concepts independently and discover the endless possibilities of math. The challenge isn't just about memorising formulas – it is about igniting student’s passion for math! Every semester, we offer exciting activities tailored to each grade level, challenging them with brain-teasing Sudoku puzzles that combine numbers or shapes, or dive into challenges that put their number operations skills to the test. Through these creative problem-solving challenges, we hope to build confidence in their abilities and develop critical thinking skills that extend far beyond the classroom. 
We encourage all students to participate in the challenge and embark on this exciting journey of mathematical discovery!

<p><strong>Math Star Award</strong></p>

<p>The Math Star Award goes beyond top scores; it celebrates the growth mindset of our students. Each term, we recognize those who show significant improvement and a determined approach to Math. We value grit, the powerful combination of passion and perseverance that fuels students to tackle challenges and achieve long-term goals. This award acknowledges students who are determined and resilient, sticking with Math and not giving up when faced with difficulties. In doing so, it fosters a love of learning that extends far beyond the classroom.

<p><strong>Numeracy Enrichment Program </strong><br>
The Numeracy Enrichment Program, conducted in partnership with the Self-help group and supported by our dedicated Parent Support Group (PSG), offers an exciting after-school experience for junior primary students who need an additional support in Math. This program goes far beyond traditional tutoring. A stimulating environment with engaging activities, including interactive games and captivating storytelling sessions, is created. All designed to provide positive learning experiences in numeracy skills. Our team of committed parents plays a vital role, helping students delve into the world of math in a fun and memorable way. Through curated games and activities, the program aims to boost students' confidence and motivation in Math. By making learning feel fun and engaging, we hope the students can foster a positive attitude towards Math that extends far beyond the classroom walls.<br>
