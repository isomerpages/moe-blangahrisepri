<p>Finally after two years of restrictions arising from the pandemic, our Primary 5 students are able to watch the NE Show live on the Marina Floating Platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although our world has moved on to a new normal, the staple not-to-be-missed moments at the NE Show have remained constant. The aerobatic displays by the F-16 fighter jets, the landings by the Red Lions parachutists set our students screaming in excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt very lucky to be one of the lucky ones to watch the NE show. After watching the heart-throbbing &nbsp;performances put up by our defence forces, I understood the hard work that our soldiers and police force are putting in to make our country safe. I feel very proud to be a Singaporean.&rdquo; reflected Nathan.</p>
<p>The theme this year, &ldquo;Stronger Together, Majulah!, is a call for all Singaporeans to forge ahead as a united and strong people towards a better future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This theme reminds me to do my part to keep me and my family safe! We can do so by observing our personal hygiene and keeping the virus away from us! Together, we can emerge STRONGER TOGETHER!&rdquo; reflected Dinesh.</p>
<p>Xxanier also shared her thoughts with her teachers, &ldquo;I was so excited to know that we would be able to go for the NE show! I felt so proud of the female Red Lion who jumped out from the plane and landed smoothly on the ground. The show ended with the amazing fireworks and it was simply mesmerising!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The P5s were indeed glad to be back at the floating platform, celebrating what makes Singapore, Singapore!</p>
