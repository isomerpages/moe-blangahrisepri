<p>The LEAP Award was launched by our late President SR Nathan in 2011 and awarded by the Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan every year to recognise exceptional teachers who have made a positive impact in nurturing students from the heart. These teachers believe that their students have the potential to excel beyond their capabilities. The Award also aims to motivate all teachers in Singapore to strive to be nurturing and effective educators. Congratulations to Mr Goh, our Year Head for Middle Primary, for having been conferred the LEAP Award 2020!</p>
