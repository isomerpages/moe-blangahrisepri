<p><strong>Viewpoints: Empowering our Blangahnites!</strong>
</p>
<p>Viewpoints, a tiered modular communication programme, brings out the critical
writer, confident debater, creative photographer, and conscientious journalist
in every Blangahnite!</p>
<p>Viewpoints promotes 21st century competencies such as civic literacy,
communication, collaboration, and critical thinking skills. Students are
empowered to express their viewpoints in written, and verbal form - from
newsletters, photographs to news broadcasts and debates.</p>
<p>All students benefit from Tier 1 English (EL) and Mother Tongue (MTL)
communication programmes that enhance language skills and design authentic
learning experiences through Photo, Print and Broadcast journalism.</p>
<p>Broadcast journalism equips the middle primary students with script writing
and presentation skills. They present their scripts in front of the camera
with confidence. In addition, in the MTL programme, they pen a level newsletter,
and learn basic news-reporting skills to convey facts and opinions.</p>

<p>The EL debating programm e equips upper primary students with oracy and
critical thinking skills to present viewpoints to support a stand. Through
intra and inter-class debates, most students get to pit their wits against
one other on topics that are thought-provoking and relevant.</p>

<p>Similarly, our primary 3 Chinese students come together to pen a level
newsletter for their Mother Tongue classes, where they learn to basic news-reporting
skills and to convey facts and opinions.</p>
<p>Through our Young Photographers programme, all students are equipped with
valuable skills to create and communicate stories through their lenses.
From their photographic products, the learning is then extended into the
language arena, as creative or poetry writing in the English or Mother
Tongue languages.</p>

<p><strong>Deeping the learning for our High Ability Learners</strong>
</p>
<p>High Ability Learners of the English and Mother Tongue Languages are also
selected for our Accelerated Programme to Enhance students’ eXperience
(APEX), and Chinese Junior Reporter programme respectively, where we further
impart the craft of journalism to them.</p>
<p>Under the Chinese Junior Reporters Programme, students are equipped with
basic news-reporting skills and play the role of a junior reporter to conduct
interviews and write news reports. Students are also given opportunities
to act as a columnist to tell their personal stories and express their
opinions. Click&nbsp;<strong><a href="/2020/11/11/chinese-junior-reporters-dian-dian-di-di-vol-2-2020/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a></strong>&nbsp;to

<p>English APEX offers a platform for our High Ability Learners of English
to come together to brainstorm content and pen their very own student newsletter.
BRavo! Is our BRPS student e-newsletter, written for students, by students.
Guided by Mr Roger Jenkins, a renowned Singaporean storyteller and drama
coach, our English APEX students shared tips on surviving HBL, lessons
learnt from Covid-19, anecdotes of their fondest memories of the unprecedented
year and creative acoustic poems of a pandemic. Read the first issue of
BRavo!&nbsp;<strong><a href="/files/BRAVO_final_13Jan2020_FINAL-1.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a></strong>!</p>

<p>Finally, a special cadre of young photographers also continue to deepen
their photography skills at the MediaKids CCA. Through the CCA, they acquire
advanced skills through authentic photography experiences. Their writing
skills are also augmented through training to express themselves through
creative writing and poetry alongside their photography. The MediaKids
are the official photographers for school events and even national events
such as the Singapore Youth Festival. Visit our Young Photographers’ webpage<strong><a href="/our-distinctive-programmes/young-photographers/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a></strong>&nbsp;and
