In Blangah Rise Primary School, blended lessons incorporating self-directed and collaborative learning, are carried out during Tamil lessons. Our students use the iPad, Student Learning Space (SLS) and other apps such as Kahoot and Nearpod for online activities.
<p><strong><em>Tamil Language Fortnight<br></em></strong>The Tamil Language Fortnight is a platform to promote the use of the Tamil language and to instil passion in the language and culture. Our students gain new experiences through a variety of language and cultural activities. These activities help to motivate students to use the language in their daily lives.</p>

“நான் தமிழ் மொழியைப் பற்றி அறிந்துகொண்டேன். எனக்கு விடுகதை பிடித்திருந்தது. பூக்கள் செய்வது வித்தியாசமான அனுபவமாக இருந்தது.”
<p>“I’ve learnt about Tamil Language. I liked solving the riddles. Making paper flower was a new experience for me.” – Amelia Sudha, Primary 6</p>

<p><strong>Inquiry Based Learning in Tamil<br></strong>Inquiry Based Learning (IBL) engaged our students in self-directed and collaborative learning. With the authentic learning experience, IBL also promotes critical and inventive thinking skills in our students to solve real-world problems. In Tamil lessons, students carry out Inquiry-Based Learning in Tamil on a given topic. They gather information and data, based on the topic, and discuss with their peers to gain a better understanding. Teachers, as facilitators, provide the platform and guidance for students to ensure they head in the right direction with their data collection and discussions.</p>
