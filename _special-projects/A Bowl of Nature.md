The book is inspired by the significance of nature in Telok Blangah and the green spaces surrounding our school. Nestled in the southern region of Singapore, Telok Blangah, which translates to "Cooking Pot Bay" in English, is a unique and beautiful area with a rich history.

The undulating terrain, verdant foliage, and sparkling waters of the bay form a natural tapestry in which our school is set in. The green spaces in this area include Telok Blangah Hill Park, Mount Faber Park, Hort Park, Kent Ridge Park and Labrador Nature Reserve. These spaces form the Southern Ridges of Singapore. Interestingly, these green spaces, when marked on the map, resemble the shape of a bowl.

Weaving the ideas of a cooking pot and a bowl together, this book reminds us of the way we are learning, working, and living in harmony with nature.

We hope that this book will serve as a source of inspiration for all those who love nature and appreciate the beauty of our world.
