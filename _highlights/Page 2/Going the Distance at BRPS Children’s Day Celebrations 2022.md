<p>This year's Children's Day Celebrations was special and certainly a meaningful learning experience for both students and teachers. We started the day with Walk-A-Jog at West Coast Park, followed by class picnics.</p>
<p>The Walk-A-Jog built up a "can-do" school spirit as our students, teachers, School Advisory Committee (SAC), Alumni and parents came together to help raise funds for Singapore Children’s Society. Our SAC members pledged to donate $1 for every student who completed the Walk-A-Jog within a stipulated time. All in all, 354 students completed the Walk-A-Jog within the stipulated time.</p>
<p>Huang Xinru Victoria (3S) shared her experience of the special day,&nbsp;“The picnic was the best part of the day. We could eat, talk, laugh and play with our friends once we were done with the run. Besides that, it was encouraging to see our very own teachers cheering us on during the run! It was definitely my best Children’s Day!!".</p>
<p>After the Walk-A-Jog, we had class picnics. The class picnic fostered greater class bonding as the students came together to plan and organize this&nbsp;fun yet meaningful activity. The children brought their own picnic mats, snacks and games as they took ownership of their learning. They even enthusiastically cleared up after themselves after their picnic, mindful that this was a public park.</p>
<p>After we left West Coast Park, the Children’s Day Celebrations continued in the school hall with games led by our Parents Support Group (PSG) and teachers. Spirits were high as students cheered each other on to complete challenges and quizzes set by their parents and teachers. One challenge even got students to keep three balloons up in their air for 1 minute using only one hand! After all the excitement, we ended the day with an award ceremony to celebrate our students’ achievements in National School Games 2022.</p>
<p>Thank you teachers, parents, PSG, Alumni and SAC, PSG for your support and making this year’s Children’s Day special. Your support has made a difference in the lives of our Blangahnites!</p>
