<p>We are proud of our 3 budding artists – Catherine (P2), Isha (P2) and Naqiu (P6) – whose Seeds of Encouragement artworks were selected by SingHealth Polyclinics and made into postcards to appreciate their Office of Patient Experience healthcare officers. The group consists of about 150 officers across SingHealth institutions. On 15 September, SingHealth representatives showed their appreciation by giving our 3 artists a Care Pack each. Thank you, Catherine, Isha and Naqiu for bringing encouragement to others through your artworks!</p>
