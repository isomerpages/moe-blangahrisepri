<p>For Chinese Language, students participated in online quizzes, hands-on
tasks, and activities like lantern painting and Chinese dye. These activities
not only engaged students but also helped them appreciate the rich heritage
associated with the Chinese language. Japheth, a Primary 5 student, enjoyed
painting lanterns, feeling as if he were part of a real Chinese festival.
Primary 1 student Matilda found clay modeling to be a creative and tactile
experience, while Mr Chua, our Chinese Language teacher, noted that the
students developed strong bonds and interacted comfortably in Chinese during
these activities.</p>
