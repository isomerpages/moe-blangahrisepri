<p>"I felt proud when I was able to hold the National Singapore Flag as a Singaporean. What makes it more spectacular is that it was my very first time to be involved in the National Day Observance Ceremony." - Humaira</p>
<p>"The feeling was different because this time I got to hold the flag and walk slowly towards the flag poles. Even though I felt nervous, it was a good experience." - Shanaz</p>
<p>"I felt good as I was selected to represent the school in the Observance Ceremony. It was a mixed feeling of being scared and excited because everyone in the school was watching. I was glad I did not mess up and executed the plan." - Guan Jun</p>
<p>True to this year's National Day theme, &ldquo;Together Our Singapore Spirit&rdquo;, BRPS begun the day&rsquo;s celebration with a simple and solemn Observance Ceremony at the parade square, led by selected students from 6 Topaz. From the comfort of their respective classrooms, the students were then brought to listen to the National Day message via Zoom. . The school was treated to a spectacular Virtual Choir performed by students from the Junior Primary, choreographed and produced by Ms Judy Kong and Mdm Kimberly Koh. This was followed by another online video montage to celebrate the life lessons learnt from our local athletes in view of the Tokyo Olympics 2020. The video was made possible by the Young Photographers and produced by Ms Seow Wen Yi, accompanied by a music composed by Ms Ruth Leong.</p>
<p>Amid the tightened Covid-19 measures, the mood of the celebration was raised several notches higher when students and teachers engaged in the various classroom activities. Teachers in class organized an inter-house NDP quiz with prizes to test our students&rsquo; knowledge of Singapore and the National Day. While the quiz was ongoing, the presence of the RSAF helicopters carrying the Singapore flag flying above the Telok Blangah airspace added to the exuberant and perfect backdrop to our celebration.&nbsp; Despite the prevailing safe management measures, BRPS had a phenomenal celebration indeed!</p>
