<h4><strong>Active Lifestyle Day</strong></h4>
<p>"On Active Lifestyle Day, STEM Club taught two Primary 2 classes how to create a balloon car using recyclable materials. When we started with the first class, I felt challenged by the task as I was not sure what the car would look like. Our teacher then guided us by showing us a video. I felt relieved as I had more ideas after the video. The car that we had created looks good but did not work as well as I had hoped. Although I was a little disappointed, I was also happy to have learnt something new."<br><em>Zhang Zexin</em></p>
