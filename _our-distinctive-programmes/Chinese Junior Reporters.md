<p>“准备好，开始！“(Ready, standby, start!)</p>
<p>“早安您好，我是布兰雅坡小记者陈心搏，请问我可以访问您吗？” (Good morning, Sir. I am Junior Reporter,
Mills, from Blangah Rise Primary School. May I interview you please?)</p>
<p>Our Chinese Junior Reporters were getting ready to report on the latest
school event. The programme provides a platform for students to hone their
Chinese Language skills by using the language in an authentic setting.
It aims to equip students with basic news-reporting skills, such as conducting
interviews, writing news reports, filming and editing news reports and
basic photography.</p>

<p>Through this programme, students will be able to improve their language
skills holistically as the platform creates opportunities for them to practise
the four language skills – listening, speaking, reading and writing.</p>

<p>This programme further promotes 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century skills such
as communication skills, collaborative skills, technology literacy and
critical thinking skills. These skills are important as we prepare our
students for the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century workforce. In addition, they
will be equipped with public speaking and social interaction skills. They
become more confident and learn the importance of teamwork. Our Junior
Reporters also had the chance to learn from external partners such as SPH
News Reporter and Radio Deejay!</p>

<p>Listen to what our students have to say about the programme!</p>
<p>“I like the Junior Reporters programme because we have the opportunity
to learn more things. I like interviewing people and writing articles.
I learnt to write newsworthy articles, edit videos, interview people and
how to be a good news anchor through the programme. I also learnt to be
responsible, confident and diligent.” (Phua Ser Yen 6 Topaz)</p>
<p>"After participating in the programme, my Chinese has improved. I learnt
interviewing skills and understand the importance of being responsible.
I could also manage my time better.” (Judith Seow, 6 Topaz)</p>
