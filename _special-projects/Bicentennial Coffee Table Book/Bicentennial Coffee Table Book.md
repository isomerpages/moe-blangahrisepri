<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Singapore Through Children's Eyes: Coffee Table Book</strong></h3>
<p>To commemorate the Bicentennial Year, Blangah Rise Primary School and MOE Kindergarten @ Blangah Rise have produced a coffee table book entitled "Singapore Through Children's Eyes".</p>
<p>The book chapters include our children's responses to old images and historical facts of Telok Blangah, interviews of long-time residents of Telok Blangah, children's photographs and reflections on iconic places in Singapore, and their hopes and aspirations for the future of Singapore. The book ends with an extension of &ldquo;Telok Blangah&rdquo;, a song written by Singapore singer-songwriter and film music composer, Kevin Mathews, using content from the earlier chapters.</p>
<p>As our children learn about the history of Singapore and pen their hopes and aspirations for the nation's future, they develop a deeper understanding of enduring traits of our forebears, namely openness, multiculturalism and self-determination. Through this, they grow in their sense of pride to be Singaporean.</p>
<p>Each book costs $40 and the full proceeds from the sale of the book will be donated to the President&rsquo;s Challenge. To purchase a copy of the book, please contact the school at 6271 7387 or email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:brps@moe.edu.sg">brps@moe.edu.sg</a>. While stocks last!</p>
