As one of Singapore's major cultural festivals, Deepavali is a celebration that symbolizes the triumph of good over evil. We celebrated Deepavali on Tuesday, November 7, 2023, which saw the hall adorned with vibrant lights, creating an atmosphere brimming with joy and happiness. The event commenced with a light-up ceremony led by our School Leaders, followed by an array of energetic dance performances by the students.
The celebration included a video introducing the origins of Deepavali and a scintillating Dance performance by P3 & P4 students which captivated the audience. Mahasina (3 Opal) said, “I was so happy when I was dancing. The cheering by the audience made me more confident while dancing”.
Amelia and Devesh's presentation enlightened us on how Deepavali is celebrated in Singapore. They discussed the sweetmeats served during the festival and the morning rituals of Hindus. Expressing their gratitude for being chosen as emcees during their graduation year, they highlighted that Deepavali is celebrated by Hindus and Sikhs.
Following this, a simple quiz engaged the audience, and the PSG elevated the program with their lively Deepavali dance performance. Krithvik (1 Topaz) said, “I really enjoyed the P3 & P4 dance performance and was also excited about the quiz!”.
The celebrations provided valuable insights into the importance of preserving our culture and taking pride in our identity, serving as a beautiful platform to usher in Deepavali. During FTGP, we also organized various Deepavali art and craft activities, allowing students to appreciate the diversity in our multi-racial and multi-ethnic society.
Many thanks to our dedicated PSG for the beautiful rangoli designed especially for Deepavali celebrations. They were made of colorful rice and petals and it attracted many of our students and teachers. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed the concert and eagerly anticipates next year's celebration. To all who celebrate, Happy Deepavali!
