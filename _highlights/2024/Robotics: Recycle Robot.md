In the first two weeks of Term 2, Primary 4 students embarked upon an engaging exploration of robotics, teamwork, and environmental stewardship. Utilising Lego SPIKE Essential kits, their objective was the construction of a 'Recycle Robot' capable of navigating specified zones under their direct control. Throughout the five sessions, this project ignited hands-on learning while empowering students to investigate coding concepts within the crucial framework of environmental responsibility.

Each session presented stimulating prompts such as, "How might the Recycle Robot's performance be enhanced?" and "How does your design differentiate itself from existing solutions?" These inquiries fueled creativity and collaboration, inspiring teams to continuously refine their creations. The culmination was the "Big Little Helper 2.0," a symbol of student innovation and their dedication to building a more sustainable future.

This hands-on experience extended beyond the acquisition of coding and programming competencies. It provided valuable opportunities to nurture a generation of problem-solvers and innovative thinkers equipped to address future challenges. Emphasising 21st-century skills aligned with MOE outcomes, students actively engaged in inventive thinking as they developed robots capable of addressing real-world problems. 

Adaptive thinking was also evident as students tackled challenges requiring them to design, program, and refine their robots for optimal performance. Seo Jun shared, “ I liked the challenges of improving our robot so that it could travel faster than the previous one.”

The final challenge served as the zenith of the learning experience, demonstrating the cumulative, progressive nature of their knowledge acquisition and their ability to collaborate effectively towards a common goal. Kai Ting said, “We took on different roles during the sessions. I enjoyed both designing and coding.”

This was truly an enriching learning experience for our students!
