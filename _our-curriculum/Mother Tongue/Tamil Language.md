<p><strong>Inquiry Based Learning in Tamil<br></strong>Inquiry Based Learning (IBL) engaged our students in self-directed and collaborative learning. With the authentic learning experience, IBL also promotes critical and inventive thinking skills in our students to solve real-world problems. In Tamil lessons, students carry out Inquiry-Based Learning in Tamil on a given topic. They gather information and data, based on the topic, and discuss with their peers to gain a better understanding. Teachers, as facilitators, provide the platform and guidance for students to ensure they head in the right direction with their data collection and discussions.</p>
