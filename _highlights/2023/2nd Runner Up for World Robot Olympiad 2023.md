This September, our young coders in the STEM Club took part in the World Robot Olympiad (WRO) RoboMission and Future Innovators Competition. The theme of the competition this year is ”Connecting the World”. Students investigated how robots can help both shipping and digital technology infrastructure to be safer, more sustainable and more efficient. Through this platform, students not only showcased their technical prowess in coding on Micro:bits and Spike Prime, they also embarked on a journey of innovation and problem-solving to create solutions that could potentially shape the future. 

Minh Anh, Ashley and Zarinfaariha from Primary 3 tackled the issue of the last-mile delivery of packages. They created and coded a robot that can move on land and in water to deliver packages whilst reducing manpower demands. This innovative and efficient solution won them a Participation (Silver) in the Future Innovators Competition. Our Primary 4 team comprising Judah, Dave and Ruvanthigaa attended to the pressing problem of marine debris. Their solution is an autonomous robot that can detect and collect trash floating in water. This robot would automatically locate and collect any solid items floating in water such as marine debris. Their elegant and sustainable solution won them the 2nd Runner Up in the Future Innovators Competition.

“This challenge allowed me to be creative and see how I can apply what I know to solve real-life problems!” Minh Anh shared. Students participating in the World Robotics Olympiad RoboMission are not just competing; they are embarking on a transformative journey that would mold them into future innovators. Through STEM education, problem-solving challenges, and exposure to cutting-edge technology, we foster creativity, teamwork, and adaptability – qualities that are essential for success in the rapidly changing world of technology and innovation. As these young minds rise to meet the challenge, they are undoubtedly taking their first steps toward shaping our future.
