<p>The storytelling session narrated the tale about how the green dragonflies
and their friends played their part to save Berlayer Creek and the environment,
as well as raised awareness on climate change. Towards the end of the storytelling
session, the ‘characters’ led the audience in pledging their support to
be more environmentally conscious through the practising of the 5Rs: Refuse,
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Repurpose.</p>
