Our students took part in prestigious Mathematics competitions where they were able to show their chops in critical and analytical thinking!
At the Raffles Institution Primary Mathematics World Contest (RIPMWC), which aims to promote interest in Mathematics and develop problem-solving skills, Nathanael Chin Chi Yi obtained the Distinction award and Rian Hong obtained the Merit Award. Rian shared, “I would like to thank my mathematics teacher Ms Ho for giving us challenging problems to solve during lessons.” 
Another event, the Asia Pacific Mathematical Olympiad for Primary Schools (APMOPS), organised by Hwa Chong Institution, is an annual event that sets out to generate greater interest in Mathematics among pupils and sharpen their problem-solving skills. At this event, Nathanael Chin Chi Yi of Primary 6 Sapphire obtained a Bronze Award. He shares his inspiration: “My father inspires me by giving me challenging mathematics problems. We often discuss solutions together and I treasure that bond with him over our love for the subject,” Nathanael said.
We are also proud to share that Vo Catherine Tu of Primary 5 Sapphire was awarded a Bronze Award in the Visual Spatial Mathlympics for All Singapore Primary Schools 2023. She too, was inspired by a parent to develop a love for learning. Catherine reflected, “I am very happy to have obtained the Bronze Award. I am grateful to be given the opportunity to take part in the competition. Thank you to my mother for always encouraging me to go beyond what is being taught at school.” 
Well done students and congratulations on your achievement!
