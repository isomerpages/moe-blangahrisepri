<p>We are excited to share that&nbsp;we have our former Blangahnites, who are our current Alumni members, as Guest Speakers for the Career Talk,&nbsp; an ECG activity.</p>
<p>The main aim of the career talks&nbsp;with&nbsp;alumni&nbsp;is to&nbsp;offer our current P6 Blangahnites an opportunity to have a lively discussion with the speakers about&nbsp;their&nbsp;careers.</p>
<p>Ms Gokki &amp; Ms Punitha shared their experiences as auditors to our Blangahnites and had an engaging discussion with them</p>
