In the fast-paced world we live in, change is the only constant. At Blangah Rise Primary School, we stand firm in our commitment not only to support students in navigating these changes but also to empower them to take on challenges and seize new opportunities.

Our educational philosophy revolves around providing our students with a well-rounded education that equips them with skills crucial for their future endeavours. We believe in instilling future-ready skills   that prepare them for their future. Through partnering our parents, we work hand in hand to reinforce these essential skills and values, ensuring our students receive 	a forward-looking education.

**Our Values**

Here at Blangah Rise Pri school, values are not just taught but are woven into the very fabric of our curriculum. Our Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) programme is dedicated to cultivating students of integrity, empathy, and excellence.   We prioritize building strong character, fostering critical thinking and ethical decision-making. We cherish the partnership with parents, recognizing that together, we can truly make a meaningful impact.

In our school, we wholeheartedly embrace the Virtues Project, a global initiative promoting the daily practice of virtues. Through the implementation of the Five Strategies, we actively guide our students towards discovering deeper meaning and happiness in their lives. 

Clara Chu,   a Primary 4 student, shares, "Ms Teo always talks about virtues like kindness in class. It makes our classroom environment very positive and kind." 

This project serves as a powerful tool for parents and teachers alike, empowering students to embody virtues such as kindness and honesty in their daily school life.

Building a strong sense of community and belonging 

Our school-based CCE curriculum integrates the 7-Habits   . Learning Experiences, programmes to benefit the community and opportunities to practice and demonstrate these habits are specially designed for our students. By working alongside partners such as Lion Befrienders, Peopleâ€™s Association, and Sports SG, as well as through our Values in Action initiatives, we actively demonstrate these habits to support those in need.
