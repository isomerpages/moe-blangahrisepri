<p>Oh, the places you’ll go! And go they did when Blangahnites visited the Island of Salamasond and Whoville on&nbsp;<em>Read With Dr Seuss Day</em>&nbsp;at Blangah Rise Learning Campus on 9 March 2021.</p>
<p>Our MOE Kindergarten preschoolers, primary one, two and three students were introduced to Dr. Seuss and his zany writings, from&nbsp;<em>Horton Hears A Who</em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>Yertle The Turtle</em>. This was done&nbsp;through&nbsp;pre-recorded Readers’ Theatre presentations of the two titles by our teachers. The videos were screened in class to the delight of the pupils who were thrilled to spot their subject teachers playing the different characters in the stories.&nbsp;Rinzen,&nbsp;a Primary three student shared, “I was thrilled to see my teachers on screen!”</p>
<p>In the lead up to the event day, English language teachers read selections from the Dr. Seuss collection to their classes. Boxes of the famed author’s books were also available in class for the students to read independently. On the actual day, the main highlight was the presence of Dr. Seuss’ famous mascot, the Cat In The Hat. Our Vice-Principal, Mrs Leong-Ho Hil May, was game enough to dress up&nbsp;as&nbsp;the Cat in The Hat to conduct a live reading of&nbsp;<em>Green Eggs and Ham</em>&nbsp;to the preschoolers and primary school students. Zin Zin, a Primary three student, shared excitedly, “I enjoyed having my picture taken with Dr Seuss’ books and I was so surprised to see the Cat In The Hat in my class!”</p>
<p>All these are our school’s efforts to seed the love of reading in our children. It is our hope that we have ignited a spark to light the way for our students to explore the world of reading. To quote Dr. Seuss himself, “The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go.”</p>
