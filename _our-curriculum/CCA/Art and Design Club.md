<p>Keen to develop your creative thinking skills through art? Interested to explore different media such as paint, batik dyes, water colour, oil pastels and mixed media? Join the Art and Design Club! We aim to nurture art enthusiasts into holistic and well-rounded individuals, embodied with great character and resilience through the process of art making.</p>
<p><strong>Empowered</strong><br>In the Art and Design Club, members not only learn art skills, but also teach others. They run collaborative activities with Red Cross members by setting up art and craft making booths. Our members manage the whole process from ideation to the actualisation of the activity.</p>

<p>Opportunities to demonstrate teamwork and leadership qualities abound! Club members led their younger peers in art activities during Active Lifestyle Day. Cheyenne, a Primary 5 student, said, &ldquo;We get to lead our juniors and organise CCA activities on our own. At first I was shy but now I am able to communicate with people better. When I work in a group, I get to collaborate with others and combine ideas. In the process, we hone our skills and become better and more confident leaders.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Enriched<br /></strong>In line with our school&rsquo;s Learning for Life Programme (LLP) on environmental education, students carry out Upcycling projects where &ldquo;unrecyclable&rdquo; waste is turned into something of value. They learn to transform unwanted items into usable products. Check out the plant holder which we had created for participants of The Green Snapshots (TGS) Nature and Heritage Trail!</p>

<p>In 2017 and 2019, we participated in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Art Exhibition and obtained Certificates of Recognition. This year, Kelly, Rihana, Kayla, Chloe and Mae worked under the guidance of their teachers, Ms Yanti Binte Rahim and Mrs Esther Loh to create an art piece based on the theme Artist and Citizenship. Their artwork &ldquo;Time to Time&rdquo; was selected for the on-site exhibition at the National Museum of Singapore from 5 July to 21 July 2019.</p>
<p>Our student artists&nbsp;also conducted an SYF Artist Talk workshop at the National Museum of Singapore.&nbsp;They facilitated the art-making process with young participants from other schools and created another piece of mixed media artwork.</p>
<p>We welcome you to join us and grow in your creativity and self-expression through art!</p>
