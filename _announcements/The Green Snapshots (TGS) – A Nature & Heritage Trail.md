TGS marks its return with a public trail on 22 July 2023. Student-docents will guide participants on a learning journey to different hotspots around Telok Blangah and its surrounding vicinity. They will provide an in-depth and personal sharing of the history, flora and fauna of the area.

The trail is built on the school’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP) – Environmental Education, which weaves nature into the curriculum and provides experiential learning activities. During the 2½-hour long guided tour, the student-docents will also share about the unique architecture and development of the area over the years, as well as engage participants in fun hands-on activities.

To sign up for the trail, please visit the school website. Participation in the trail is on a first-come, first-served basis.
