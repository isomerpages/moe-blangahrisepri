<p>Cozy. Meaningful. Magical.</p>
<p>These were some words used to describe the Teachers&rsquo; Day celebrations held in Blangah Rise Learning Campus (BRLC) on 4 September 2020. On this day, all students and staff celebrated Teachers&rsquo; Day using Zoom as a platform to connect in the midst of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Firstly, students and teachers enjoyed an online concert in their classes. The concert kicked off with our Principal, Mr Foo, sharing his message of appreciation to all educators for their hard work. Mr Foo led all the teachers in reciting the Teachers&rsquo; Pledge to reaffirm our commitment to be true to our mission to bring out the best in our students and to work with parents and the community. Following that, our Blangahnites and Parent Support Group showed their appreciation and gratitude via performances and videos. Students were excited to learn more about their teachers through a game show. To end the concert, all students were encouraged to clap for their teachers to applaud their efforts in this challenging year.</p>
<p>After the celebration, teachers attended a workshop conducted by Mr Bottles. Laughter was heard throughout the various breakout rooms as Mr Bottles led the teachers to learn magic acts that could be applied in the classroom to engage and motivate students. It was indeed a meaningful and magical day to appreciate BRLC teachers for their hard work.</p>
