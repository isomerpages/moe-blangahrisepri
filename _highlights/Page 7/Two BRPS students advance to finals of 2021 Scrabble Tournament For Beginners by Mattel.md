<p>This is the second year that our school participated in the 2021 Scrabble Tournament For Beginners Southeast Asia (Online), organized by by Mattel. However, unlike the previous year, this year's tournament structure was expanded to include participants of other Southeast Asia countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. The top 4 winners of each country will represent their nation at the Virtual Southeast Asian Finals.</p>
<p>Our four students, Uthaila (4 Sapphire), Nathanael (4 Topaz), Yogitha (5 Sapphire) and Michael (5 Sapphire) were tasked with competing against students in other primary schools in the Singapore category on 14 August 2021. All four gave their best throughout their games. At the end of the day, Nathanael and Michael were placed in the top 12 and proceeded to the Grand Finals, which was held on 15 August 2021. There were 24 participants in the Grand Finals vying for the top 4 positions to represent Singapore for the Southeast Asian Finals.</p>
<p>Both students managed to chalk up 2 wins in the finals. Overall, Nathanael and Michael did the school proud when they achieved 13th and 20th position respectively. Despite not being placed in the top 4 of the finals, we are proud of them for taking on this enriching learning experience!</p>
<p>"Although I feel a little disappointed that I got 13th place, it was a good experience since it was my first time. I hope to get a better result by practising more, if there is another online Scrabble competition." - Nathanael (4 Topaz)</p>
<p>"I feel that it was very hard and I had not thought that everyone would play so competitively. I think that if I have another opportunity like this, I will be more prepared." - Michael (5 Sapphire)</p>
<p>"During the online Scrabble competition, I learnt many new words. Even though I did not get to the next level, I still will not give up and will do well for the next competition, I gave my best in the competition." Yogitha (5 Sapphire)</p>
<p>"I was quite nervous because I had to think fast. It was a good experience though. I hope to take part in future online Scrabble competitions if I'm given the chance. I'll be ready!" Uthaila (4 Sapphire)</p>
