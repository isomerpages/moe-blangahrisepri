Racial Harmony Day at Blangah Rise Learning Campus was a colorful and meaningful event that celebrated the diversity of our school community and the rich cultural heritage of Singapore. A week's activities were planned from 18 July with the day filled with engaging activities and heartfelt performances, showcasing the unity and understanding that thrive among our students, teachers, and staff.

  

To promote friendly competition and teamwork, the school organized a Chapteh competition with a focus on racial harmony. Students from different classes came together to participate in various games and activities that highlighted the values of cooperation, respect, and empathy. The infectious spirit of camaraderie that filled the air truly embodied the essence of unity in diversity.  
  
As part of the celebration, students had the opportunity to play traditional games such as Congkak, Carrum, Five Stones and Chapteh during recess. A mini exhibition was held to showcase various ethnic costumes and their rich history. Blangahnites indeed had a fun and memorable experience learning about the diverse ethnic groups.
