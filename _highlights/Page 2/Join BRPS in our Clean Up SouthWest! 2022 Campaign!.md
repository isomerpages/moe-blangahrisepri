<p>Blangah Rise Learning Campus is taking part in the Clean Up SouthWest! 2022 recycling initiative in collaboration with SouthWest CDC once again. Recycle your old clothes and used paper for a greater cause!&nbsp;We accept old newspapers, magazines, paper, clothes, fabrics and cartons. More information can be obtained by scanning the QR code on the flyer.</p>
<p>A food donation will be made to the needy in the SouthWest District for our recycling efforts. For every 3kg of clothes donated, 1kg of rice will be donated to underprivileged families. For every 4kg of newspapers/magazines/paper/cartons donated, 1 packet of noodles will be donated. So come on! Let us do our part to help those in need.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Date: 12 September 2022 to 25 October 2022</p>
<p>Location: Drop off your recyclables at the BRPS Guardhouse (near main gate)</p>
<p>Parents/Guardians can choose to pass the recyclables to their child/ward or come in person to drop them off at the guardhouse (near main gate).</p>
