<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&ldquo;On my honour,<br /></strong><strong>I promise that I will do my best,<br /></strong><strong>to do my duty to God and the Republic of Singapore,<br /></strong><strong>to help other people,<br /></strong><strong>and to keep the Scout Law.&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>The Scout Promise and the Scout Law are recited by the BRPS Cub Scouts every Monday morning before they begin their CCA session. Everyone is given the opportunity to lead in the recitation. Alan, a Primary 5 Cub Scout, says, &ldquo;I always feel nervous whenever it is my turn to lead my friends. But it helps me to be more confident and understand the importance of upholding the Scout Law and Scout Promise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Discipline, leadership, teamwork. The development of these skills forms the bedrock of the repertoire of activities and opportunities in BRPS Scout CCA. Activities such as outdoor cooking, tent-pitching, knot-tying, map-reading, track and trail and first aid, equip the Cub Scouts with camp crafts through learning by doing. Most of the time, the BRPS Cub Scouts have to work together in their packs to complete the activities. &ldquo;Teamwork is very important in our CCA. We need to have the end in mind and work together towards the same goal,&rdquo; says Shane, a Primary 6 Cub Scout.</p>

<p>At the end of four years (Primary 3 to Primary 6), BRPS Cub Scouts would not only have badges to showcase their achievements, but also strength of character and life skills. Primary 6 Amron strongly believes in that. &ldquo;Scouting teaches me the meaning of perseverance. Regardless of how many times you fail, you must keep on trying and never give up. I will always remember that a Scout has courage in all difficulties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The importance of serving others is also emphasised through participation in Scout district, school and community events such as Job Week, Donation Draw, World Water Day, National Day Marching Ceremony, Telok Blangah Community Club&rsquo;s National Day Observance Ceremony and Commemoration of Scout Founder&rsquo;s Day. Arianna, a Primary 4 Cub Scout, says, &ldquo;My friends and I represented our school to attend the National Day Observance Ceremony at Telok Blangah CC. We led the Telok Blangah residents in reciting the National Pledge. It was an opportunity for us to give back to the community. It was a memorable experience for all of us.&rdquo;</p>
