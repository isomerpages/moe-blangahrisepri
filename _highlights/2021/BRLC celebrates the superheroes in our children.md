<p>Celebrating Children’s Day in 2021 was unique. It was celebrated in three parts with the theme,&nbsp;<em>The Superhero in Me</em>. First, the English Department prepared a pre-event Reading Programme. During the HBL period, students were loaned story books and graphic novels to read at home. This was to develop their love of reading and to improve literacy within the school. Similarly, through HBL, we arranged for an e-Author’s Talk by the author of&nbsp;<em>Danger Dan and Gadget Girl.</em></p>
<p>On 7 October, the school celebrated second part of Children’s Day via a Zoom Webinar as it was still within the HBL period. The event started off with our Principal, Mr Foo giving a very meaningful and touching address to the students on Children’s Day. Thereafter, a message by Ms Sun Xueling, Minister of State, Ministry of Education, was read. To celebrate the successes of our students in the various competitions they had participated in this year, we gave out prizes during a Prize Giving Ceremony. The Parents’ Support Group also made dedications to our students and that was followed by a fun and enjoyable online workout session led by our teachers. The celebration rounded off with a Game Trivia and a video trailer prepping students of the upcoming final part of the celebration<em>. Knush, a primary 3 student, shared, “I enjoyed the Children’s Day celebration via webinar. I love that I get to play the Game Trivia with other students. It was challenging to unscramble the letters to find the answer. But I enjoyed the second part of the celebration even more.”</em></p>
<p>On 13 October, when all of our students have resumed physical schooling, the school swung into the second part of Children’s Day celebration. Our teachers and parents came together to celebrate our children and to send the key message: We can all be a superhero. It just requires intentional practice of the seven habits and virtues. In line with this, many teachers donned superhero costumes for the morning’s celebration. A video comprising many short videos was played displaying the teachers as superheroes in various scenarios sharping their saw – keeping fit through fun exercises, championing various causes and even coming to the rescue. This was done to celebrate the virtues in our students and to develop their passion for learning through drama. The students had fun breaking open the piñatas created by the Parent Support Group specially for the celebration and completing various learning activities – decorating superhero masks, creating power cuffs, selecting superpowers for their own heroes amongst others.&nbsp;<em>Miss Munirah shared, “I thoroughly enjoyed all the segments of the Children’s Day celebrations. Almost felt like one of the kids watching the teachers in awe whilst the superhero video played.”</em></p>
