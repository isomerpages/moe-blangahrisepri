Our Primary 4 students recently embarked on an enriching Museum-Based Learning (MBL) excursion to the Kreta Ayer Heritage Centre, where they learnt more about the lifestyles and occupations of Singapore's early settlers. During this trip, they had the opportunity to witness Chinese tea-making, explore the tools utilised by early settlers, and view the beautiful costumes worn by opera singers. This excursion enabled our students to broaden their educational experience beyond the classroom. They also gained a deeper understanding of Chinatown's cultural heritage by learning about the history and significance of the street names in the area.
