<p>Ms Paula Craige, Head of Tanglin Trust Infant School, and Mrs Angela Dawson, Assistant Head Teacher, visited Blangah Rise on 7 May 2019. The Tanglin Trust Infant School serves children aged 3 to 7, hence, they were particularly interested in visiting the MOE Kindergarten and Junior Primary classrooms and understanding our curriculum.</p>
<p>On 25 June, the MOE Kindergarten and Junior Primary teachers then had the opportunity to visit Tanglin Trust Infant School to learn about the school&rsquo;s curriculum and programmes. Arising from this professional exchange are further possibilities for collaboration between our two schools, with one being planned for Children&rsquo;s Day!</p>
