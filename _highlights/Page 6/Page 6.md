<p>Celebrating Children’s Day in 2021 was unique. It was celebrated in three parts with the theme, The Superhero in Me. First, the English Department prepared a pre-event Reading Programme. During the HBL period, students were loaned story books and graphic novels to read at home. This was to develop their love of reading and to improve literacy within the school. Similarly, through HBL, we arranged for an e-Author’s Talk by the author of Danger Dan and Gadget Girl.</p>
