<p>&ldquo;Are you ready? The time starts now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone in Blangah Rise Learning Campus was engaged in&nbsp;<em>Read for Charity</em>, a charity drive conducted by the National Reading Movement. One book would be donated to selected beneficiaries for every 10 people reading for 15 minutes. In previous years, all students and staff would gather in the school hall to read. This year, because of Covid-19, the charity drive was conducted in the classrooms via Zoom.</p>
<p>Amelia, a 9-year-old student, said, &ldquo;I was able to read a book that I liked and do a good deed at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms Junaidah shared that the charity drive was a good experience for the Primary 1 students who were participating for the first time. The students brought a variety of fiction and non-fiction books. They were so engrossed in reading that they did not realise that 15 minutes was up.</p>
<p>Miss Athena added, &ldquo;The older students expressed that they were glad to be able to serve the less fortunate as a whole school community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the timer has stopped, we will continue to cultivate the love of reading in our students and develop them to become caring leaders.</p>

<p>During this unprecedented season, we have seen Singaporeans from all walks of life stepping forward to contribute to the nation in different ways.</p>
<p>According to the authorities, blood collection in the first week of the circuit breaker period dropped to less than a quarter of the usual levels. Blood stocks are required to supply transfusion needs from surgeries, general medicine, and accident and emergency cases.</p>
<p>Mr Shang, our Head of Department for PE and CCA, responded to the appeal of Singapore Red Cross and donated his blood.</p>
<p>We interviewed Mr Shang and asked him to share his experience with us.</p>
<p><em>Q: Why did you respond to the appeal for blood donation?</em></p>
<p><em>A: I used to donate blood when I was younger but somehow stopped. I feel that we can contribute to help others in different ways. If I stay healthy and can donate my blood, I would gladly do so.</em></p>
<p><em>Q: How was the blood donation experience?</em></p>
<p><em>A: Blood donation is a safe process. The average adult has 4 to 5 litres of blood. During a donation, only 350 to 450 ml of blood is drawn. That's only 10% to 12% of the total volume of blood in your body. The fluid (plasma) portion of your donated blood will be replaced in a few days. (Source: Health Science Authority)</em></p>
<p><em>Q: How did you feel after the blood donation?</em></p>
<p><em>A: I felt fine after the blood donation. I had a good dinner and went to sleep. The next day, I did a short run and felt normal. Blood donors can donate blood again after 3 months and I look forward to my next blood donation.</em></p>

<p>It has been a week since all our students returned to school. One of the activities that they look forward to every day is the unstructured playtime during recess!</p>
<p>Safe Management Measures (SMM) are adhered to during unstructured playtime. Sports implements are provided during recess where students could still have fun in a safe manner. To ensure SMM, spot markers are placed at least 2 metres apart for individual students to practise skipping or develop badminton skills.</p>
<p>After play, students would do a wipe down of the sports implements they use. They take responsibility for ensuring that the sports implements are clean and safe for another students&rsquo; use.</p>
<p>Isha, a Primary 2 student, shared, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fun. I get to use the badminton racket to control the shuttlecock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Camille, another Primary 2 student, said appreciatively, &ldquo;At least I get to play. It&rsquo;s better than not being able to play at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Phase 2, we will continue to support our students&rsquo; holistic learning and design positive school experiences. Stay safe, stay active, stay happy.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>29 June 2020</strong></h3>
<p>We ended last Friday&rsquo;s home-based learning for our Primary 4 and 5 students with a series of exciting questions that helped us understand the different perspectives and thoughts of our students. These light-hearted questions also managed to bring out the creativity in our students, and for some, their responses definitely brought smiles to the teachers.</p>
<p>When asked what superpower they would like to have, many students hoped they could fly and teleport to places. They would want to spend time visiting places with their family and friends. Interestingly, Jesslyn, a Primary 5 student, hoped to have special powers to help nature and communicate with animals. She would like to grow more trees and heal the earth, making it well again.</p>
<p>Another question that led to many fascinating responses was &ldquo;In your opinion, what is the BEST occupation in the world?&rdquo; Common responses included: doctors and nurses &ndash; to save lives and help the sick; scientists &ndash; to make important discoveries, produce vaccines and medicine to beat viruses; and YouTubers and software developers &ndash; to create unique online content to engage users purposefully. Certainly, the responses would not be complete if no one pays homage to one of the BEST occupations in the world &ndash; teachers! Zhi Lin, our Primary 4 student, shared, &ldquo;Being a teacher is the best occupation! Teachers do many things. Not only do they teach us in the classrooms, they also teach us the right values.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Today, all our students from Primary 1 to 6 return to school as a community. We look forward to creating many more enriching learning experiences that will help our students achieve their goals and dreams. Onward to Semester 2 in the new normal.</p>

<p><em>Wipe down. Wipe out.</em></p>
<p>More than ever before, Mr Henry Look has been on his toes to ensure the safety of all students and staff in school. As the school&rsquo;s Operations Manager, he oversees estate management, safety and security, and logistics support. These are critical areas to look into for the current two outbreaks &ndash; Covid-19 and dengue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the school holidays, the operations team was busy cleaning and disinfecting different parts of the school like the classrooms, the canteen and the school hall. We even set up safe distancing markers to guide our students &ndash; all in time to welcome our students back to school on 2 June,&rdquo; Mr Look shared with our Chinese Junior Reporter, Jeffrey Zhan Yong Jing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since the re-opening of school in Term 3, I have been at the main gate from 6.30am to make sure that all the students wear their masks properly and have their temperature taken, as well as check that everyone is well when entering the school,&rdquo; Mr Look added.</p>
<p>Jeffrey was curious about the challenges Mr Look faced and how he overcame them. He learnt that it was a challenge to clean the whole school especially when the cleaners were split into two teams during the Circuit Breaker. They reported on alternate days and had staggered work hours. Therefore, he decided to pay more attention to cleaning and disinfecting the areas that would be heavily used by the students.</p>
<p>Mr Look is very proud of his operations team. &ldquo;We are very lucky to have a group of very hardworking cleaners to ensure that the school is properly cleaned and disinfected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Look shared with Jeffrey 3 things that students could do in the fight against COVID-19. Firstly, stay at home if you are unwell and see a doctor. Secondly, wear a mask when you are out. Thirdly, practise safe distancing.</p>
<p>Besides managing Covid-19, Mr Look has also been busy with dengue prevention. After all, we are facing&nbsp;the largest dengue outbreak in Singapore&rsquo;s history. &ldquo;The school carries out anti-pest measures every Tuesday and Friday. We also schedule mosquito fogging on a monthly basis. We have trained our staff, security and even students to frequently scan for potential mosquito breeding grounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Look&rsquo;s face turned serious. &ldquo;We cannot be careless, as mosquito breeding can endanger lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Look is confident that just as our students are now familiar with the Covid-19 wipe-down routine, they are well-versed in the 5-step mozzie wipeout. He emphasised, &ldquo;The best way to prevent dengue is by removing stagnant water in flower pots, vases or buckets, as mosquitoes only need a small puddle of water to start breeding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeffrey ended the interview by wishing Mr Look &ldquo;工作顺利&rdquo; (may everything go smoothly at work) and &ldquo;身体健康&rdquo; (good health).</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been selected to work on a MISSION to create a FUTURE&nbsp;<strong>Blangah Rise Learning Campus</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our P4 APEX students received this note at the start of Term 3. They were being invited to participate in a Design Thinking Programme facilitated by Mr Raziff Lau, a Service Designer from GovTech, and our very own teachers, Mr Patrick Goh and Ms Athena Tang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The future is in your hands. Come and join the mission now!&rdquo; our Vice-Principal, Mrs Leong-Ho Hil May, said in a mission brief shown to the students in the first of six virtual sessions. Students thus joined the Design Squad and embarked on a mission to design a future-facing Blangah Rise Learning Campus. They formed groups to look into four aspects of future school &ndash; Green BRLC, Learning BRLC, Inclusive BRLC and BRLC Community.</p>
<p>To learn the four stages of the design thinking process &ndash; empathise, ideate, prototype and present &ndash; students carried out interesting tasks such as creating a wallet for their peers. They explored the socio-emotional competencies required of design thinking &ndash; empathy and resilience. They learned how to craft meaningful interview questions and carried out interviews with their peers, teachers and parents to truly understand what the &ldquo;end user&rdquo; actually wants.</p>
<p>Yi Kai commented, &ldquo;I learned how to connect with other people and understand their needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through multiple rounds of feedback to refine their ideas, students learned the true meaning of resilience and the importance of not giving up when their first ideas fail. Zhi Lin said, &ldquo;I have learnt ways to improve on something and make it much better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truly, learning happens everywhere, not just within the four walls of the physical classroom. Watch this space for our students&rsquo; creation of Future BRLC!</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>23 June 2020</strong></h3>
<p>Having to learn about computational thinking and coding using the SLS platform instead of through face-to-face sessions did not dampen our students&rsquo; enthusiasm when they were participating in Code for Fun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I enjoyed the code.org activities a lot since the written code is shown in Javascript. I would like to learn more about other types of code, such as VBS. Although Javascript is easy to code, there are limitations. VBS is easier to write but it is restricted to the desktop and not compatible with browsers. I do hope I can learn about quirks in Javascript too,&rdquo; said Wunna, a Primary 5 student, who aspires to be an astronaut when he grows up.</p>
<p>Code For Fun is a collaboration between MOE and Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA). It is part of the school&rsquo;s Aspiring Confident Engineers (ACE) programme. Students learn visual-based programming language using robotic kits and microcontrollers. When the Circuit Breaker started, the 10-hour face-to-face training by IMDA trainers was adjusted so that virtual lessons could go on.</p>
<p>The students learnt how computational thinking could be applied in everyday situations. Basic programming concepts such as events, loops, variables and functions were taught to the students. Students also applied their logical thinking to solve problems which were broken down into bite sizes.</p>
<p>Reflecting on her experience of programming a virtual robot, Aggie shared, &ldquo;I enjoyed how I was able to learn a new thing about coding in each lesson. My personal favourite was this game where I had to choose certain actions for the robot to do to overcome a certain obstacle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kristelle added, &ldquo;I really enjoyed the videos provided as they taught me how to make my instructions more detailed. I want to learn how to improve my coding skills. Maybe I can do &lsquo;real&rsquo; coding in future!&rdquo;</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Masks Sewn for a Good Cause</strong></h3>

![](/images/Combined-22-June-1.jpeg)

<p>Mdm Kwok Imm Mui, mother of our K2 twins, Ethan and Elza, is part of a group of volunteers across our island who are sewing face masks for foreign workers and the needy. She believes that Singaporeans should play a part to help those most affected at this time by the Covid-19 outbreak. She started sewing at home during the Circuit Breaker. Her two children helped in packing and counting the masks as Mdm Kwok thought it would be good to teach them about empathy for others.</p>
<p>She can sew between 20 to 30 masks daily which go to CYC Made to Measure and Social Gifting. CYC started an initiative to gather volunteers to sew 300,000 masks for the migrant workers. Social Gifting is a Social Enterprise that also called for volunteers to sew reusable masks that are given to the elderly in nursing homes and the needy.</p>
<p>To date, Mdm Kwok has sewn more than 300 masks and is still tirelessly supporting this worthy cause. She has also generously donated some masks to some of our MK children. When we asked Ethan and Elza about their mum&rsquo;s efforts, we can see that they are happy and proud of her &ldquo;labour of love&rdquo;.</p>
<p>We laud Mdm Kwok for her act of volunteerism to help Singapore fight Covid-19!</p>

<p>Ever wondered how you can build a toy car using materials you can find at home? How do you design it to get it to travel the farthest?</p>
<p>During the May holidays,&nbsp;we invited Dr Ho Shen Yong to carry out &ldquo;Project Toy Car&rdquo; to engage our STEM Club students. Dr Ho is the Associate Dean (Academic) of the College of Science in NTU and Principal Lecturer in the School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences. He teaches Engineering Physics and was designated NTU Educator of the Year in 2018.</p>
<p>Dr Ho shared, &ldquo;It was a fun experience explaining Science and Technology to primary school children. Probably until we try to create or make something, we will not see the challenges. This toy car project is an opportunity to learn about Science and also learn about learning. It is important that the children have taken a first step, as &lsquo;a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step&rsquo; &ndash; no matter how small the first step is. We also often just look at the end product but not the hard work in the process, but &lsquo;all things are difficult before they are easy&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>We perspire and learn together.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>We perspire and inspire one another.</em></p>
<p>As students now go straight to the classroom upon arrival in school, the time in the morning before the start of the first period now becomes another prime opportunity for teachers to connect with their students.</p>
<p>Using the poem as a hook, Mr Shang shared his personal experiences and engaged his Primary 3 students in a lively conversation. Playing the role of a Teacher Mentor, he used the language of virtues and offered companioning by listening to the students sharing their own reflections.</p>
<p>Students were encouraged to reflect on their own Covid-19 experiences. By listening to each other&rsquo;s thoughts, feelings and experiences, they learned to empathise with their peers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through the poem, we can tell our friends about our feelings,&rdquo; Xxanier said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We experience each other&rsquo;s thoughts and feelings,&rdquo; Sophia added.</p>
<p>The students also used the language of virtues in sharing what they had learned. Devesh said, &ldquo;We learn to help and be kind to one another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through the teacher mentoring process in the morning, we endeavour to connect with students intentionally to be their &ldquo;coach, counsellor and cheerleader&rdquo; and to help them to support one another.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>17 June 2020</strong></h3>
<p>Mdm Kimberly Koh recalls what it was like being a student. &ldquo;There was always this fear about the English language. Simply too many things to remember, such as grammar rules! Now that I am a teacher, the challenge for myself is to make lessons interesting for my students.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mdm Koh uses different tech tools during her English Language lessons to deepen students&rsquo; engagement and raise their interest level. The tech tools also allow formative assessment to take place so that she can check for students&rsquo; understanding, obtain data on their learning and use this data to adjust her teaching. This is particularly important as she teaches Primary One students who may not have acquired the metacognitive or language skills to express what they know or do not know.</p>
<p>Before Home-Based Learning took place, she was already using tech tools like&nbsp;<strong><em>Mentimeter</em></strong>,&nbsp;<strong><em>Kahoot</em></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><em>Plickers</em></strong>&nbsp;with her students in class to check for their understanding. With Home-Based Learning, she realises that it is even more important to help students continue to be engaged in the different online learning activities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I put myself in the shoes of a 7-year old and ask what helps me learn better. To engage my younger students, I choose&nbsp;<strong><em>DeckToys</em></strong>&nbsp;for grammar and vocabulary items as there are accompanying study sets which function as flashcards for them. Students apply their learning through activities such as unscrambling the letters, matching games and providing open-ended responses. They could go on a rescue mission or escape from the clutches of a monster!&rdquo; Mdm Koh added.</p>
<p><strong><em>Wordwall</em></strong>&nbsp;is another interactive ICT tool that Mdm Koh is exploring. She uses the games on&nbsp;<strong><em>Wordwall</em></strong>&nbsp;for formative assessment. &ldquo;My students had learnt the different word classes (i.e. nouns, verbs and adjectives) previously before we went on Full Home-Based Learning, so I created a few games with Whack-A-Mole on&nbsp;<strong><em>Wordwall</em></strong>&nbsp;to check for my students&rsquo; understanding. Through gamification, the students learn to persevere and not give up. They often want to challenge themselves to score a new high and I can also monitor their achievement level through their multiple attempts. Can you imagine the delight on the students&rsquo; faces when they outdo themselves and obtain a new record?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a member of the Singapore Learning Designers Circle, Mdm Koh has also picked up tips from the community of educators, one of which is to conduct spelling tasks effectively and to track students&rsquo; learning and progress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was really thrilled when I got to know of what I could do with&nbsp;<strong><em>Flippity.net</em></strong><em>.</em>&rdquo; Using a spelling strategy that is similar to&nbsp;<em>Look, Say, Cover, Write, Check</em>, words and sentences are read out to the students and the spelling results are sent to the email addresses of teachers. Students can use that platform to learn and practise their spelling independently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mdm Koh summarised her experience with the new ICT tools. &ldquo;This Home-Based Learning period has opened up new opportunities for me. I have grown to be a more resourceful educator and I can carry out blended learning for my students more confidently now &ndash; anytime, anywhere. Also, I strongly encourage all of us as educators to take bold steps forward to harness technology. If we don&rsquo;t try, we will never conquer!&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Ms Sharon Ismail, Author</strong></p>
<p>Authors&rsquo; Talks is an annual event where local authors are invited to share their experiences and expertise with the students. Hearing an author speak is a privilege and we thought of how we could continue with the programme while maintaining the safe distancing protocols.</p>
<p>Ms Sharon Ismail, author of their STELLAR text,&nbsp;<em>What Sallamah Didn't Know<strong>,</strong>&nbsp;</em>kindly consented to an e-interview. Ms Sharon Ismail had been engaging our students for the past few years and it was always a pleasure working with her. We collated the questions from the students, which included "Is Sallamah a real person?", "What is your next book?", and "What inspires you?&rdquo; Ms Sharon Ismail patiently replied to the students&rsquo; questions via a recorded segment. At the end of the interview, Sharon Ismail encouraged the students to continue working hard and she hoped to see them physically in 2021.</p>

<p>BRPS organised our very own Circuit Breaker Challenge during the month-long May school holidays! The challenge enabled students to explore and learn new things. A number of challenges also empowered students to plan interesting activities with their family.</p>
<p>Neharika, who is in Primary 5, had a lot of fun trying out the Tongue Twister Challenge. &ldquo;I find words that rhyme very interesting. I enjoyed creating my own tongue twister, and even asked my parents to say it aloud with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jayden from Primary 4 shared that he was very excited to see a leopard up close through AR Google. It had given him greater insights into how it looks and what he had learnt in Science lessons.</p>
<p>With the Circuit Breaker in place, our students stayed home and had extended time to bond with their families. Chiaki, another Primary 4 student, said, &ldquo;I played games with my family and we had a wonderful time together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We are heartened to see our students&rsquo; creative works. May they continue to stay curious and experience the joy of learning.</p>

<p>As students get use the Safety Management Measures (SMM), they also get used to doing Physical Education (PE) differently.</p>
<p>During PE, we ensure safe distancing and self-management. Each student will exercise within their personal space and place their personal items (for example, water bottle, hand sanitiser, mask and Ziploc bag) on their right.</p>
<p>Students will remove their mask and safe keep it in their Ziploc bag before PE starts and wear their mask when the lesson ends. Throughout the physical activity, students can stop and drink water, ask to refill their water bottle or go to the restroom, one student at a time. As students are guided to practise self-management, physical activity time is optimised and the lesson is able to proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>From their feedback, we know that the students enjoy and appreciate PE. After a 30-minute workout of crunches, push-ups and jumping jacks, Jeanette from Primary 6 Sapphire was perspiring and smiling. She said, &ldquo;That was a good workout.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To support students returning to school after the Circuit Breaker, Form Teachers brought students through a &ldquo;Back-to-School Stronger Together&rdquo; Package. The package aimed to support students to develop personal resilience, social and community resilience, and build up resilience as a nation.</p>
<p>The package provided information that helped students understand that the changes in the last 2 months might not have been easy but everyone did their best and overcame some of the difficulties and challenges. Besides checking in with students on their feelings about coming back to school, teachers also reviewed the safe measures that students had to adhere to. Students were also taught different ways they could show care and support to their friends in school without compromising the safety measures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The package provided me with a lot of useful information that I needed to know for my daily school routines. Knowing what to expect also helped me to be less anxious and calm down,&rdquo; said Jia Wei, Primary 6 student.</p>
<p>Irina, another Primary 6 student, commented, &ldquo;We were given opportunities to share what we had done during the Circuit Breaker. It was very interesting to hear from my friends!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This Back-to-School Stronger Together package will be conducted over the four weeks in June during the weekly Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) as students adjust to this new phase of their school experience.</p>

<p>This week, it was our Primary 1 to 3 students&rsquo; turn to return to school.</p>
<p>Aaron from Primary 3 Topaz exclaimed, &ldquo;I really miss my classroom and the canteen. They feel so spacious and airy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The students came to school fully prepared with their face masks and excited to learn in a safe environment. For a start, the Form Teachers welcomed the students with a Back-To-School package and conducted a quick check-in with everyone. They guided their students on the safe handling of masks. Students had their fixed exam-style seating arrangements and were reminded about safe distancing and personal hygiene routines.</p>
<p>While Vivian from Primary 1 Topaz shared that it was uncomfortable to wear the mask for the whole day, she valiantly explained, &ldquo;The mask helps to keep me safe. I am just so happy to come back to school because I can see my teachers and friends!&rdquo; Vivian&rsquo;s sentiment was shared by many of her friends.</p>
<p>What else did our younger students miss other than their peers and teachers?</p>
<p>Marvell from P1 Opal squealed in delight, &ldquo;Bee hoon! I miss the SATS food. I had bee hoon and fishballs today.&rdquo; Syahmina from P1 Sapphire shared with her friends that she missed the recess food too. She had chosen Cheesy Hawaiian Wrap for herself.</p>
<p>With staggered recesses in place, our lower primary students were led to their fixed positions at the canteen benches. After putting down their belongings, they washed their hands in an orderly manner before consuming their food. At the end of recess, they did a complete wipe-down of the tables.</p>
<p>We look forward to the week with our Primary 1 to 3 students before they start on another week of HBL.</p>

<p>Ella from K2 Integrity could not wait for Term 3 to start. &ldquo;I am so happy to come back to school! I miss my friends and teachers,&rdquo; she said. Indeed, many children could not conceal their excitement when they saw their friends and teachers again, and you could see their eyes light up as they caught sight of familiar faces.</p>
<p>The MK staff have put in place safe management measures to ensure that our kindergarten is clean and safe for the children to return. Tape markings spaced one metre apart are placed along the corridors and outside the toilet. Posters are put up on the walls to remind children of safe distancing.</p>
<p>Ms Marina Ho, our Centre Head, says, &ldquo;All our staff will be extra vigilant in looking out for the well-being of the children. We will practise safe measures to overcome Covid-19 together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Children are advised to bring their own stationery to school and not share it. Those who do not have their own stationery are provided clean stationery in a Ziploc bag. Learning Centre toys and manipulatives are regularly disinfected and placed in Ziploc bags. Children play with these items in their own small groups. No cross sharing between groups or classes is allowed. Outdoor activities like sand and water play have been suspended as they involve physical contact.</p>
<p>Children practise social distancing when queuing for the toilet or snacks. Teachers supervise the children in washing and disinfecting their hands more frequently, such as before and after snack and going outdoors. Face masks are also worn during outdoor playtime as children are most excited then and converse with their friends frequently.</p>
<p>In class, the children have &ldquo;safe&rdquo; places to sit. Teachers wear a face shield when teaching in front of the class and switch back to the face mask during small group activities. Mini microphones may be used by the teachers so that the children can still hear their teachers clearly.</p>
<p>At arrival and dismissal, parents also have to adhere to safe distancing when they line up outside the side gate to drop off and pick up their children. In the canteen, where children wait for the rest of their friends to arrive before proceeding to their classrooms, they sit in their own groupings at designated seats.</p>
<p>Our MK teachers are indeed happy to see the children after almost 8 weeks of school closure and are eager to ensure that our children catch up on key concepts so that learning in Term 3 can continue seamlessly once more. Teacher Jas says, &ldquo;We really miss the children and will do our best to connect with each child.

<p>To support the foreign workers who are re-located outside their dormitories as part of the circuit breaker measures, SATS has been appointed as one of assigned caterers by the government to provide nearly 180,000 healthy balanced meals to these foreign workers.</p>
<p>Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan commented, &ldquo;We have many professional central kitchens fully equipped and resourced to churn out large quantities of healthy and balanced meals on time and in line with specific dietary requests. SATS is one example, where SATS kitchen is now busy serving our dorms. Feedback from their new customers has been very positive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>SATS Catering provides up to 20,000 meals a day to the foreign workers dormitories. To fulfil the large consumption of rice by the foreign workers, SATS Catering uses 12 huge ovens instead of its usual 4 ovens to prepare the rice. This is on top of the large automated rice line which can cook up to 600kg of rice in one hour, which helps to ensure that warm meals are served on time to the foreign workers.</p>
<p>Mr Khaw shared pictures of the meals prepared by SATS Catering which comprised fish curry with seasoned vegetables (non-veg halal); fish and hot bean sauce with seasoned vegetables (oriental); and biryani with vegetables (vegetarian).</p>
<p>From preparing inflight meals for planes 20,000 feet above the ground to bento boxes for our migrant workers, SATS truly lives up to its brand promise of Passion to Delight!</p>
<p>Kudos to our BRPS partner in these challenging times!</p>

<p>Students were excited to return to school on the first day of Term 3. While the Primary 6 students had returned to school earlier for lessons, the Primary 4 and 5 students were happy to be able to see their teachers and friends again after two months!</p>
<p>Recognising that students would need time to transit back to school, teachers did not rush back into curriculum recovery but spent time checking on their students&rsquo; well-being. They discussed the safety measures that everyone should adhere to in school.</p>
<p>Our Primary 5 student, Kechester said, &ldquo;When we line up, we make sure we are one metre apart. Therefore, our line is longer than usual. This is important because we want to stop the virus from spreading!&rdquo;</p>
<p>During recess, the students were seated in a fixed alternate seating arrangement. They did not sit where the benches were marked out with an &ldquo;X&rdquo;. Quraisha, a Primary 6 student, shared, &ldquo;Each table can only have three students each. We were also advised not to mingle with students from other classes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her classmate, Naqiu, said, &ldquo;It is inconvenient to talk to our friends because our voices cannot be projected clearly through the mask. But I know that it is important for everyone to play our part and wear a mask properly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To minimise congestion at the school gates and bus-stops, dismissal was staggered for the different levels. Students taking the school bus remembered their assigned seats and that they should minimise talking while in the school bus.</p>
<p>Together as a school community, we will continue to be proactive in keeping school safe for everyone.</p>
