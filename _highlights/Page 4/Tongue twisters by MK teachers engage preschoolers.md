<p>In our PLC (Professional Learning Community) discussions, our Mother Tongue Language teachers wanted to improve the students&rsquo; language pronunciation. As research has shown that the use of &ldquo;Tongue Twisters&rdquo; (TT) helps to improve language articulation, our MTL teachers decided to use this strategy in their classes.</p>
<p>Different compositions of TT were put together and recited at the beginning of lessons on a bi-weekly routine. This was done over a period of five weeks, and our teachers made careful observations to track the progress of the students. Three key areas were noted; pronunciation of vocabulary, understanding of the language, and pronunciation when reading our big books. Pre and post observations carried out showed that our children had made improvement in these 3 areas.</p>
<p>Our teachers were satisfied with the outcome and have continued to use tongue twisters in our MTL classes in future. Our pre-schoolers also found reciting TT fun and engaging. Zafran, from the Malay Language class that was observed, reminded his teacher to allow the class to recite the TT. He said &ldquo;I like to say the tongue twisters as it is fun and I try to say it faster each time!&rdquo;. Teacher Norhidah shard, &ldquo;The reciting of tongue twisters gave the children the opportunity to exercise different parts of the muscles in their mouth and this helps to improve articulation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For their wonderful effort, the MTL teachers&rsquo; were awarded the Outstanding Contribution Award (OCA).</p>
