On April 26th, 2023, our school celebrated Hari Raya with great enthusiasm. The festivities began with a delightful performance by our friends from MOE Kindergarten, who danced to the enchanting melodies of Hari Raya songs.

The event's emcees, Illiyyin and Batrisyia from 4 Opal, then introduced us to various traditional Hari Raya outfits, including the Kurta, Baju Kurung, and Punjabi suit, which were beautifully worn by both our teachers and students. A video presentation featuring our students sharing their favorite aspects of Hari Raya was also shown, and Batrisyia expressed that visiting her relatives gave her the opportunity to spend time with loved ones.

In addition, a quiz segment provided an opportunity for us to learn more about Hari Raya, and our Parent Support Group created a beautiful video montage of well-wishes. Our talented parents decorated the General Office with stunning decorations.

To conclude the festivities, MOE Kindergarten friends, teachers, and students returned to the stage to sing the finale song, and we would like to wish all our Muslim friends a joyous "Selamat Hari Raya Aidilfitri"!
