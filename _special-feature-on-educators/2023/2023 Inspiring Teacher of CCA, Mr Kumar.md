Meet Mr. Kumar, the inspirational force behind our basketball Co-Curricular Activity (CCA). Since joining our school in January 2022, he has transformed our students' lives, fostering character excellence and sportsmanship that transcend the court.

Under Mr. Kumar's guidance, our Junior Boys emerged as champions in the Tier-2 group of the National School Games (NSG) in 2022. In 2023, our Senior Boys secured the honorable position of 1st runner-up in the NSG preliminary round, advancing to the second round.

Beyond coaching, Mr. Kumar communicates regularly with parents, ensuring holistic development. On and off the court, he emphasizes "character first," instilling a sense of privilege and honor in representing our school in NSG.

Experience the power of Mr. Kumar's transformative leadership as he nurtures our basketball CCA students toward character excellence and sportsmanship. Join us on this incredible journey of personal growth and athletic achievement.
