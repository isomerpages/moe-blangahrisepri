<h4><strong>A Nature &amp; Heritage Trail by Blangah Rise Primary School (BRPS)</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Saturday / April 29, 2019</strong></p>
<p>To commemorate the Bicentennial, our student-docents of Blangah Rise Primary School led members of the public on The Green Snapshot Trail around Telok Blangah and Mount Faber. The students shared about the area&rsquo;s rich and green history, including facts about historical landmarks such as the Temenggong Mosque and even&nbsp;<em>kampong&nbsp;</em>remedies made from plants in the area. &nbsp;A long-time resident of Telok Blangah, Mrs Teh-Ooi Gim Siew, shared with us that despite urban developments, the estate has managed to stay tranquil and green.</p>
<p>At Mount Faber View, participants took time to pen their dreams for Singapore. Ms C. Dharani wrote, &ldquo;I would like us to live as a harmonious community despite differences we may face. I would also like Singaporeans to be friendlier to each other and to the environment.&rdquo; Likewise, our student-docent, Nick Yew, also envisioned &ldquo;a Singapore where our environment and heritage are conserved for future generations.&rdquo;</p>
