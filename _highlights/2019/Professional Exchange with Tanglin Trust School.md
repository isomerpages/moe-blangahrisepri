<p>Ms Paula Craige, Head of Tanglin Trust Infant School, and Mrs Angela Dawson, Assistant Head Teacher, visited Blangah Rise on 7 May 2019. The Tanglin Trust Infant School serves children aged 3 to 7, hence, they were particularly interested in visiting the MOE Kindergarten and Junior Primary classrooms and understanding our curriculum.</p>
<p>On 25 June, the MOE Kindergarten and Junior Primary teachers then had the opportunity to visit Tanglin Trust Infant School to learn about the school’s curriculum and programmes. Arising from this professional exchange are further possibilities for collaboration between our two schools, with one being planned for Children’s Day!</p>
