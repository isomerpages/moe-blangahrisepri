<p>For Marvell from 6 Sapphire, Deputy Head Prefect, the Investiture was
a moment of pride. He said, "I was proud to be appointed Deputy Head Prefect.
When the whole school sang the school song together, I felt incredibly
thankful for this opportunity to serve."</p>
<p>Kai Xiang from 6 Topaz, Head Prefect, reflected on his growth. "I was
honoured to be appointed Head Prefect. Delivering my speech to the whole
school was a significant moment – I took a deep breath, embraced the opportunity,
and spoke with confidence. It was a proud achievement, and I am committed
to being an empathetic and disciplined leader."</p>
<p>Congratulations to all our student leaders! May your journey inspire others
to lead with courage and purpose.</p>
