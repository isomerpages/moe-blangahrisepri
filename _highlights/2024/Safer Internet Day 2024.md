<p>Safer Internet Day took place on 6 February and it is an annual global
initiative which aims to promote safer and more responsible use of online
platforms and mobile devices among children.</p>
<p>We commemorated Safer Internet Day starting with an announcement during
assembly of its importance to foster a safer online environment for everyone.
During recess, our Cyberwellness Ambassadors and Peer Support Leaders provided
great support, and engaged their peers in discussions on the importance
of balancing their time online and how to cultivate a healthy and balanced
relationship with technology. Our Cyberwellness Ambassadors and Peer Support
Leaders then guided their peers to make pledges for responsible screen
use.</p>
<p>To extend our students’ learning, form teachers discussed the pledges
which our students wrote during the recess activity and emphasised the
importance of navigating the digital landscape responsibly. In addition,
all students completed a lesson on Student Learning Space (SLS) with a
quiz to reinforce their learning.</p>
<p>Let’s all come together promote healthy screen habits and digital well-being
within our school community!</p>
