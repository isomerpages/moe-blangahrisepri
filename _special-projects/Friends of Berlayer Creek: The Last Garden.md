<p>The storytelling session narrated the tale about how the green dragonflies
and their friends played their part to save Berlayer Creek and the environment,
as well as raised awareness on climate change. Towards the end of the storytelling
session, the ‘characters’ led the audience in pledging their support to
be more environmentally conscious through the practising of the 5Rs: Refuse,
Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Repurpose.</p>

<p>After the storytelling segment, our Student Leaders led the children in
a hands-on activity whereby they used recycled materials and repurposed
them into a pencil holder.</p>

<p>Marvell from 5 Sapphire shared, “The storytelling was a great experience
for me. I feel more confident presenting to the public now. I also had
a lot of fun interacting with my young audience.”</p>
<p>The student leaders were committed in giving their very best for the storytelling
session. Kai Xiang from 5 Topaz said, “I was delighted that I was able
to memorise and deliver my lines emotionally well. It was a humbling experience
to be able to interact with children younger than me!”</p>
<p>Abigail from 5 Sapphire added, “I was honestly surprised that I enjoyed
myself doing something way out of my comfort zone. Through this experience,
I am more confident when speaking to strangers.”</p>
<p>Indeed, the storytelling session was a resounding success. It definitely
left an indelible mark not only on the audience, but our Student Leaders
too as they continue to grow and serve the community and beyond.</p>
