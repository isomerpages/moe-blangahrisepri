<p><strong>A note from the Year Head, Mr Patrick Goh and Assistant Year Head, Mr Victor Lim<br></strong>The Middle Primary is a robust team formed by talented and creative teachers who will combine their strengths, skills and ideas to work together to enrich your child’s time in school. My colleagues and I aim to nurture your child to the best of our abilities. We believe in establishing a strong partnership and an open communication with parents.</p>
<p><strong>A note to parents&nbsp;<br></strong>We would like to welcome you and your child/ward to a brand new school year. We hope that the recent school break was enjoyable and well-utilised for you and your child/ward. We are delighted to see the students back in school, healthy and happy.</p>
<p>Our role is to look into all student development matters including general discipline matters and provide intervention strategies where necessary. In addition, we will monitor the Middle Primary students’ progress and work together with the teachers to address areas of growth for your child/ward so as to give your child/ward a positive school experience this year.</p>

<p><strong>LEARNING ENVIRONMENT<br></strong>Our students love to come to school and enjoy learning because our teachers create a non-threatening and conducive environment that welcomes them. Our students beam with pride when the teachers regularly put up their good work done in class!</p>

<p><strong>LEVEL PROGRAMMES IN 2020</strong></p>
<p><strong>Supervised Study Programme (SSP)<br></strong>Our teachers and student-leaders from secondary schools, junior colleges and polytechnics mentor our students by providing after-school academic support and conducting values-based activities to strengthen character-building.</p>
<img src="/images/middle2.png">
<p><strong>Project SPARK<br></strong>In our continuous effort to support our students holistically through meaningful activities and enjoyable school experiences, our creative teachers designed an after-school interest club programme – Project SPARK. This programme aims to ignite our students’ interests in indoor and outdoor sports, experiential activities such as art, music and dance, robotics and gardening, and activities that enhance our students’ general knowledge in civic literacy and global awareness. Most importantly, we would like to build our students’ sense of belonging to the school and team spirit with their schoolmates.</p>

<p><strong>Applied Learning Programme (ALP) – Robotics and STEM<br></strong>Our students explore, investigate and ask questions through analysing problems and solving it through real world examples when they are working on STEM-related projects. P3 students work on the theme “Let’s Cool It!” and Aerospace Engineering. P4 students work on the theme “Let’s Recycle!” and Environmental Engineering.</p>

<p><strong>Learning for Life Programme (LLP) – Project GAIA<br></strong>Our students seek support from the residents in the school’s neighbourhood to donate their recyclable items. Through this project, they gather data based on the recyclables collected to recommend ways to relevant organisations to promote recycling and raise awareness of the importance of caring for and protecting the environment.</p>

<p><strong>Digital Literacy – Young Photographers Programme<br></strong>Our P3 students learn how to use an Advanced Compact Camera and our P4 students learn about Tablet Photography in the Young Photographers Programme.

<p><strong>Outdoor Education – P4 Adventure Camp<br></strong>Our P4 students take part in a P4 Adventure Camp that builds their confidence and resilience and forges team spirit. Through this learning experience, our students feel enriched and have adopted a greater positive self-belief that they can overcome any difficulty no matter how tough it gets, as long as they set their minds to wanting to achieve their intended goals. We strongly believe that this camp will form an important memory of their primary schooling years.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Journeys<br></strong>Our P3 students were immersed in a multi-media sensory experience at The Bicentennial Experience at Fort Canning as part of our nation’s commemoration of Singapore's Bicentennial. This learning journey has created a deep and meaningful impact in our students as they ‘travelled’ through time to learn about Singapore’s history. Through that, they grew in their sense of belonging to Singapore and their pride of being Singaporean!</p>
