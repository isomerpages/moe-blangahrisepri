<p>Every year in Term 4, our Primary 2 students have to make a very exciting choice &ndash; the CCA that they would like to join when they are in Primary 3. On 21 October, as they went on a tour to all the CCA groups, they realised they could choose from a wide range of sports and games, clubs and societies, uniformed groups and performing arts.</p>
<p>Quraisha, a Primary 5 Red Cross member, thrilled the Primary 2 students as she demonstrated how to do a head bandage. Her volunteer, Daniel, a Primary 2 student, smiled joyfully while being &ldquo;treated&rdquo; by her.</p>

<p>Some of the other experiential activities during the CCA tour included learning to control their footwork to dribble the football to their team mates, tying knots with seasoned Scouters, bandaging their &ldquo;injured&rdquo; friends with members of the Red Cross, as well as participating in STEM Club&rsquo;s Lego WeDo activities.</p>

<p>We believe that through CCA, our Primary 2 students will experience joyful&nbsp;learning with their older peers, take on leadership roles and work&nbsp;together as a team to achieve common goals.</p>
