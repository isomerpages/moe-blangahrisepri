journey to the Geylang Serai Heritage Gallery, where they delved into the
vibrant cultural heritage of Singapore’s Malay community. Through hands-on
exhibits and engaging activities, they discovered traditional customs,
craftsmanship, cuisine, and attire, deepening their appreciation for cultural
diversity.</p>
