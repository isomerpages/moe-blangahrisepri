<p>On 7 May 2022,&nbsp; Blangah Rise Primary's first self-written and illustrated storybook - The Green Dragonflies and Their Swampy Friends - came alive! Our team of student leaders and teachers narrated the book to a full house of young ones and their parents at the library@harbourfront.</p>
<p>Accompanied by beautifully crafted props made from recycled materials, the student leaders acted as animal characters with much expression, alongside a teacher-narrator. Their enthusiasm was evident, despite the early nerves. Alara, a primary 5 student leader, shared, "I enjoyed performing in front of the large crowd. It was a great experience as it allowed us to practise the virtue of courage. If we had not overcome our nervousness, it would definitely affect our performance!"</p>
<p>Following the storytelling, our teachers and student leaders led the children in attendance in a hands-on art and craft session, where they created their own wooden dragonfly pegs. The children passionately coloured their own designs. "It was really a proud moment for all of us. A parent shared her child enjoyed both activities very much, and she also praised me for my confidence and spontaneity. I am indeed thankful for an opportunity to share our story with members of the public," said Athan, a primary 5 student leader.</p>
<p>For those who have missed the first session, there will be a second storytelling session at the library@harbourfront on 21 May, 2 pm. Plus, there will be another two sessions at the Singapore Botanic Gardens on 21 and 22 May, 4 pm.
