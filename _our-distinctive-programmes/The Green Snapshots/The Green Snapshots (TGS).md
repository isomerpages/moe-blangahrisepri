<p>The Green Snapshots (TGS) is an award-winning nature and heritage trail that invites participants to appreciate the rich and green heritage of Telok Blangah District &amp; Mount Faber. For the physical version of TGS, the trail is led by our student-docents who will bring participants to different hotspots in the vicinity. During the trail, our students share interesting information about the plants and animals that can be found in the park as well as the rich history and heritage of places in the area.</p>

<p><strong><u>Outdoor Safety Tips &amp; Being Green</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Keep to designated trails and pathways. Do stay on the trails so as not to destroy natural vegetation or disturb wildlife.</li>
<li>Watch out for falling tree branches, especially during windy and rainy weather. Do not stay under trees with heavy fruit during the fruiting season.</li>
<li>Seek shelter when there is thunder and lightning.</li>
<li>Help conserve nature. Do not pluck any plant or harm or capture any animal. Leave wildflowers for others to enjoy.</li>
<li>Do not taste any part of a plant.</li>
<li>Do not feed the wild animals. Feeding them our food will make them sick. It may also tame them and make them unable to fend for themselves. They may become aggressive towards humans.</li>
<li>Do not capture any wildlife to take back home so that others may also enjoy the excitement and experience of searching for and studying them.</li>
<li>Do not pollute our environment. Use the litter bins for any disposal of waste.</li>
</ul>
