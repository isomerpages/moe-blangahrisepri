We commemorated International Friendship Day on 4 April 2023. Dave and Heidi from 4 Topaz, Aria from 4 Sapphire and Marvel from 4 Opal hosted an exciting assembly programme for their peers in school.

During the assembly, the student-hosts shared interesting information about ASEAN – a diverse and vibrant regional grouping. In addition, the audience learned about the culture, language and other aspects about Indonesia, this year’s ASEAN Summit chairing country. Furthermore, students were also actively engaged during the quiz session. They applied knowledge gleaned from the sharing to answer the questions during the quiz.

Gail from 6 Sapphire shared that the programme was very interactive, as they had the opportunity to answer questions. Additionally, she mentioned that conducting the assembly programme was a good platform for her peers to practise public speaking and to build self-confidence.

Meanwhile, Catherine from 5 Sapphire felt that the presentation was fascinating. She learnt new facts about our neighbouring country, Indonesia.

One of the student-hosts, Dave from 4 Topaz, shared that the assembly programme was informative and noteworthy. “I am very glad that I had the chance to present in front of the school. I really enjoyed the session. I wish I could have more of such opportunities in the future.”
