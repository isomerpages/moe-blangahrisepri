<p>In February this year, our APEX (Mathematics and Science) students as well as students from the STEM Club participated in our in-house BRPS Amazing Flying Competition. In their teams, they researched and explored different ways to achieve the longest and farthest flight. Under the guidance of the teachers, each team designed their own plane. Students had the opportunities to present their ideas and findings to their peers. After rounds of trials and errors, the teams finally got had their planes taking flight. A mini-competition was also held for the teams to compete with one another. Through the activity, it showed that the students have a wealth of talent and resilience to help them achieve their goals.</p>
