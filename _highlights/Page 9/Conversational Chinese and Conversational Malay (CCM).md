<p>&ldquo;Selemat Tengah Hari, Cikgu Azlin!&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;郭老师午安！&rdquo;</p>
<p>These would have been typical greetings, except that they were uttered by Primary 3 and Primary 4 students who were learning Chinese and Malay for the first time.</p>
<p>Our students had the opportunity to learn a different Mother Tongue Language during the Conversational Chinese and Conversational Malay (CCM) Programme on the 11 March. In our multiracial society, learning a different language will help our students to interact with friends of different races in the community. They will also better understand and appreciate their friends&rsquo; culture and values. When they are older, it will help them to engage their counterparts in the region.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like CCM lessons because I get to learn a different language,&rdquo; said Carllh.</p>
<p>Zhi Lin, whose parents speak Malay, exclaimed, &ldquo;I can finally speak Malay to my parents!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We can be sure that our students are looking forward to the next few sessions of CCM!</p>
