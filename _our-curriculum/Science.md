<p><strong>Vision:&nbsp;</strong>Every child is imbued with a life-long curiosity and love for Science.<br><strong>Mission:&nbsp;</strong>To develop the innovative and creative spirit in every child.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>To effectively learn science, students need to learn more than just facts and theories. Rather, they need to construct their understanding through an iterative, collaborative process that builds and reshapes prior knowledge.</em></p>

<p><strong>Scientific Inquiry and Scientific Method</strong><br>Scientific inquiry is defined as the activities and processes which scientists and students engage in to study the natural and physical world around us. We believe that teaching the scientific method to students is to teach them how to think critically, learn, solve problems, and make informed decisions. These skills are integral to every aspect of a student’s education and life. As our students grow up in an increasingly technologically and scientifically advanced world, we give our students the knowledge and skills to be scientifically literate to thrive in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Our Goal:<br></strong>We put together a suite of Science programmes with the aim of providing students with experiences to nurture students to have a curious and rational mind, a loving heart, and an innovative spirit.</p>
<p><strong>Inquiry-based Learning using Science Kits<br></strong>The integration of science kits into the science classroom not only transforms the roles of both teachers and students but also fosters the development of self-directed learners. These kits serve as effective classroom tools to support hands-on curriculum supplements, shifting the learning environment from traditional, didactic methods to dynamic, hands-on approaches. This encourages exp  loration and experimentation, which in turn, engage all students in active and meaningful learning.</p>

<br>**Outdoor Experiential Learning Experience**<br>
The outdoor classroom fosters active, hands-on, inquiry-based learning in a real world setting; making learning a multi-sensory experience to retain knowledge more effectively. Learning in a less-structured environment, students are provided with a different learning experience from that of the classroom. Learning Journeys are also integral to enriching the learning experience of students.  They help to make real and concrete what has been learnt in the classrooms and broaden the mental horizons of our students.

<p><strong>Enrichment Activities<br></strong>To further enrich students’ learning in Science, the school partners with external agencie  s such as, Science Centre, Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), Junior Achievement (Singapore) LTD to conduct enrichment activities. Through the expertise of our partners, students take part in various engaging activities throughout the year. By working with Science Centre to bring in specimens of animals and plants, students have the opportunity to observe and compare the organisms not commonly found in their environment. To better understand energy conversion, students get to create their own wind turbines to convert kinetic energy into electrical energy to light up LED bulbs</p>
<p><strong>Recess Activities<br></strong>
The Science Department conducts activities during recess every Wednesday of Weeks 3, 6, and 9 from Term 1 to Term 3. This initiative thrives on the collaboration between our dedicated teachers and the outstanding Parent Support Group (PSG). The objectives are to enhance Science learning for our students and to develop students’ social and emotional learning. Through these activities, we aim to transcend the classroom setting, teaching science through the experiential approach  and instilling a passion for the subject. The activities encompass a range of engaging experiences. These include introducing or reinforcing scientific concepts through card games, interactive Wordwall sessions using iPads, PSG-led demonstrations and explanations of science experiments. Additionally, we incorporate STEM Champion challenges to further enrich the learning experience and stimulate curiosity among students.

</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Animal Moments</strong></span><br>This program is designed to include environmental education in our Science learning activities. Activities include assembly talks led by teachers and governmental organizations such as the SPCA and AVA and hands-on opportunities to learn how to care for small animals at the Animal Corner.
	
This programme aims to raise awareness on animal-related issues and educate students on responsible pet ownership through assembly talks conducted by teachers and government organisations like the SPCA and AVA. Students then learn to be kind and empathetic to our four-legged friends. Under the supervision of our teachers and Science Assistant, students are given the opportunities to have hands-on experiences to learn to take care of small animals.

<p><strong>Biodiversity Corridor<br></strong>The Science department emphasizes environment education by designing learning experiences and school spaces accordingly. The Biodiversity Corridor exemplifies the school's commitment to fostering socio-emotional skills and leadership qualities in students. Through the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) spearheaded by the Science Department, virtues such as care, respect, and responsibility are instilled, contributing to students' personal and interpersonal growth. Engaging with animals offers students opportunities to observe, interact, and learn, enriching their understanding of nature, ecology, and relationships. Additionally, it ignites curiosity, inspiring students on their learning and discovery journeys.</p>

<p><strong>Garden Trails - Blooming Garden and The Garden of Hope<br></strong>With the objectives of providing our students with outdoor experiential learning to complement the teaching and learning of Science as well as to provide our students with an authentic platform for Value-in-Action (VIA) project, P3 to P6 classes are each assigned a garden plot to take care of the plants. This provides opportunity for students and teachers to build positive teacher-student relationships as well as imbue in students a sense of responsibility to take care of the environment.</p>

**Tranquil Garden**

Adjacent to the Primary 1 classrooms lies the Tranquil Garden, designed to enhance student wellness. Bamboo lattices and boulders define the space, offering areas for personal reflection and small group gatherings. Custom tables and seats blend seamlessly with the surroundings. The garden employs a multi-sensory approach. It features visually striking plants like the Auracaria Pine Trees, a creatively arranged Tamarind Tree hosting epiphytes and orchids, a cascading water fountain and outdoor speakers. Our staff and students love this garden!

**Butterfly Cove**
<p>The Butterfly Cove extends beyond a mini garden for mere observation. It aims to impart lessons of growth, possibility, and environmental stewardship. As students witness the metamorphosis from caterpillar to butterfly, they learn about the delicate balance of nature and their role in preserving it. This garden serves as a source of inspiration, instilling hope and joy as students engage in the fascinating science activity of nurturing butterflies, fostering a sense of responsibility and connection to the natural world.</p>


<p><strong>Go&nbsp;<a href="mailto:Green@BRPS">Green@BRPS</a><br></strong>Going green is an integral part of being a Blangahnite. It teaches our students to respect self, others and the environment. Events such as Earth Week, World Water Day and practices such as the 4Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Refuse) are emphasised by our Green Ambassadors and Science teachers. Selected students are also given leadership opportunities to work with organisations such as NEA and Sembwaste to provide authentic platforms for them to explore environmental issues. Through such partnerships, they learn to take action to improve the environment around them and achieve awards that accredit the school’s green practices. These activities include conducting recycling drives in the school, taking part in environmental challenges and creating educational posters for both the school community.</p>

**STEM Programme - APEX**
<p>Our students in the Accelerated Programme to Enhance students’ eXperience (APEX) attend the STEM Programme. These include Robotics, Innovation Programme, Toy-making, Design Thinking, E2K and Project Work where students conduct research in areas such as aerodynamism and water conservation for group projects. We aim to help our students develop skills, habits of mind and attitudes necessary for scientific inquiry.</p>
