<p>Our heartiest congratulations to the BRPS Debate Team who has done us mighty proud by defeating their opponents at the Quarterfinals to advance to the Semifinals of the&nbsp;Wits &amp; Words 2021 Inter-school Debate Competition. In the nail-biting Quarterfinals, our debaters, Richie, Mikhael, Zhi Lin, Yi Kai, Michael and Chris, took on New Town Primary School for the motion "This House Believes Convenience Culture Causes More Harm Than Good". With a clear win, they will move on to the Semifinals of the competition on 28 April 2021. We wish them the very best!&nbsp;</p>
