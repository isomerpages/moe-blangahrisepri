<p>Stick insects visited our Primary 2 students in Term 3. The students were thrilled to see the stick insects and enthusiastically requested to handle them. So, we had some students to try! After several attempts to get the stick insect to crawl up, Gwyneth finally earned its trust and her friends applauded the attempt. She shared, &ldquo;The stick insect felt ticklish on my skin and it felt really soft to the touch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next, we tried to have the stick insect move on to another student but it just wasn&rsquo;t ready. So we might try that next time! The stick insect crawled back to the tank on its own from Gwyneth&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>P/S: No stick insect was hurt in this activity.</p>
<p>The Animals&rsquo; Corner is part of the school&rsquo;s effort to equip students with socio-emotional skills and leadership qualities. We inculcate virtues such as care, respect and responsibility to create a lasting impact on the students&rsquo; own personal and interpersonal growth through the school&rsquo;s Learning for Life Programme (LLP). The experience also provided students the platform to put the virtues into practice.</p>
